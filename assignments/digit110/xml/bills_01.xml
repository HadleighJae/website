        <p>On Board <name type="SHIP">La Touraine</name>,</p>
        <p><date date="1917-06-30">June 30th, 1917</date></p>. 
        <p>Even now that we are out of sight of land, it seems
            impossible that I am actually off to <name type="COUNTRY">France</name> and, for the
            first time in my life, traveling alone. Everything has happened so quickly since the
                <name type="ORG">American Fund for French Wounded</name> found an opening for me in
                <name type="CITY">Paris</name> that I suppose I am still somewhat dazed and
            bewildered. The fact that I don't know what it will all be like and that I can't look
            ahead makes it easier to be happy and live in the present. Of course I have had a bit of
            a taste in <name type="STATE">New York</name> of the work that the <name type="ORG">A.
                F. F. W.</name> is doing but its Headquarters in <name type="CITY">Paris</name> will
            be different in some ways I fancy.</p>
        <p>I can't get over how lucky I am to have this chance for I realize how few girls of my age
            are getting across, and I understood the grit and pluck which made you encourage me on
            my great adventure and send me along a path which has proved so dangerous of late.</p>
        <p>As we drifted down the river, in the sunset glow with two absurd tugs puffing alongside,
            I know that many eyes were moist and that the same thought was in all our minds. How
            many of this ship's company will see that sky-line again! It was very quiet, no one
            spoke much, and, little by little, the glow faded from the sky and one star after
            another appeared. I knew that you would be looking at those same stars down in <name
                type="PLACE">Lakewood</name> and that your thoughts and prayers were the same that
            filled my heart at that moment. Somehow distance does not separate, after all.</p>
        <p>We waited near the <name type="LANDMARK">Statue of Liberty</name> until midnight—a rumor
            had it that a "personage" was to come on board. This individual was shrouded in mystery
            until we put to sea when it was given out that the party which had clambered aboard in
            the night was none other than the <name type="ORG">Italian Mission</name>. Our spirits
            rose at once for, what with <name type="PERSON">Frank Sayre</name> on the boat and these
            distinguished Italian gentlemen, we shall doubtless be honored by a bigger convoy and so
            doubly safe. However, thus far we have but two destroyers following us. They can be seen
            distinctly outlined against the horizon, one on each side, and seem to be the same
            somber gray which all ships are affecting in this war. A sailor informed me this morning
            that we weren't in much danger for the first four or five days but that after that I
            might see some excitement. Here's hoping!</p>
        <p>I have a small inside cabin and my room-mate is quite a character. She is a native of
                <name type="COUNTRY">Haiti</name>, voluble and very portly—has four large pieces of
            baggage in our tiny stateroom, wears a costume which resembles a Mother Hubbard and
            smokes countless thin cigarettes that smell like incense! When I appeared, there didn't
            seem to be much room for me but, as she says, luckily I am small, and I was soon tucked
            into the upper berth with my belongings! She really isn't bad and after looking me over
            carefully told me that she didn't think we would fight and from that time has beamed
            upon me! She is going over to join her son who has been fighting with the French since
            the beginning of the war but will never go back to the Front now, having lost some
            fingers off each hand. She is so thankful, she says, that he hasn't lost more than his
            fingers.</p>
