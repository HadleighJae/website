            <subtitle time="00:00:25">In 1987, the situation comedy Horsin' Around</subtitle>
            
            <subtitle time="00:00:28">premiered on ABC.</subtitle>
            
            <subtitle time="00:00:29">The show, in which a young, bachelor horse is forced to reevaluate his
                    priorities when he agrees to raise three human children, was initially dismissed by
                    critics as broad and saccharine and not good, but the family comedy struck a chord
                    with America and went on to air for nine seasons.</subtitle>

            <subtitle time="00:01:19">To what do you attribute the show's wide appeal?</subtitle>
            
            <subtitle time="00:01:21">Charlie, listen, you know,</subtitle>
            
            <subtitle time="00:01:23">I know that it's very hip these days to shit all over Horsin' Around, but at
                    the time, I can tell you--</subtitle>
            
            <subtitle time="00:01:27">- Is it okay to say "shit"? - Please don't.</subtitle>
            
            <subtitle time="00:01:28"> 'Cause I-- I think the show's actually pretty solid for what it
                    is.</subtitle>
            
            <subtitle time="00:01:31">It's not Ibsen, sure, but look, for a lot of people, life is just one
                    long, hard kick in the urethra, and sometimes when you get home from a long day
                    of getting kicked in the urethra, you just want to watch a show about good, likable
                    people who love each other, where, you know, no matter what happens, at the end of
                    30 minutes, everything's gonna turn out okay.</subtitle>
            
            <subtitle time="00:01:50">You know, because in real life--</subtitle>
            
            <subtitle time="00:01:52">Did I already say the thing about the urethra?</subtitle>
