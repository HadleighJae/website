Well, BoJack, surely,even you would agree</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:31"><subtitle>
that the troops are heroes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:32"><subtitle>
I don't agree to that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:34"><subtitle>
Maybe some of the troops areheroes but not automatically.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:37"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:19:44"><subtitle>
Hello, sir.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:46"><subtitle>
Thank you for inviting meinto your home. It is lovely.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:49"><subtitle>
BoJack, is there anythingyou'd like to give Neal McBeal?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:54"><subtitle>
Ahem.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:55"><subtitle>
Oh, yeah, Todd?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:57"><subtitle>
What the hell is this?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:59"><subtitle>
I tried to buy the muffins,but my bank card got declinedfor some reason.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:03"><subtitle>
But don't worry,I still saved the daybecause I found this bagof stale hamburger buns.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:08"><subtitle>
I'm sorry?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:10"><subtitle>
Yeah, they're just giving themaway behind In-N-Out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:12"><subtitle>
Why does anybodypay for anything?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:15"><subtitle>
Ow.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:16"><subtitle>
Uh, Neal, as a tokenof my admiration,please accept this bagof stale hamburger buns.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:24"><subtitle>
- What?- Yes, hamburger buns.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:26"><subtitle>
It's a symbolfor how we throw our veteransin the trash, sadly,far too often.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:32"><subtitle>
I'm listening.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:34"><subtitle>
We sendour muffins overseas,and they come backas stale hamburger buns,but that doesn't meanwe should love them any less,because in their own way,aren't stale hamburger bunsjust as good?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:47"><subtitle>
Mmm.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:49"><subtitle>
American made.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:51"><subtitle>
So what you're saying is,you think I'm a hero.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:57"><subtitle>
Well, I don't know if I--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:59"><subtitle>
Say it, BoJack.Say I'm a hero.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:04"><subtitle>
You're a hero.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:05"><subtitle>
The troops are all heroes,every single one.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:09"><subtitle>
Great.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:10"><subtitle>
And I don't believesaying that cheapens the wordand actually disrespectsthose we mean to honorby turning real peopleinto political pawns.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:19"><subtitle>
Okay, you can let goof the bag now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:22"><subtitle>
Also, I am notdeeply ambivalentabout a seemingly mandatedcelebration of our militaryby a nationthat claims to value peacetelling our children thatviolence is never the answerwhile refusing to hold our owngovernment to the same standard.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:35"><subtitle>
Yeah, me neither.I think we're in agreement here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:37"><subtitle>
Furthermore, I do not findit unbelievably appropriatethat this conversation is takingplace on reality television,a genre which thrives onchopping the complexitiesof our erainto easily digestible chunksof empty catchphrases.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:51"><subtitle>
Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:53"><subtitle>
And finally, I don't--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:55"><subtitle>
Hey, look, Mr. Peanutbuttergot a bucket stuck on his head.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:58"><subtitle>
Guys, guys, where am I?Can someone tell me where I am?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:02"><subtitle>
