</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:56"><subtitle>
Your Ari Emanuels and VanessaGeckos and what have you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:00"><subtitle>
Vanessa Gecko is actuallyAndrew's agent,and she's really great.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:03"><subtitle>
Is she?I've heard that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:09"><subtitle>
I didn't realize you wereso into house music.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:12"><subtitle>
Look, I asked herto turn it down, but apparently,this volume was prescribedby Dr. Whoto treat something called"uptight dickhead disease."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:20"><subtitle>
What do you-- What do you thinkabout Sarah Lynn?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:23"><subtitle>
Oh, I don't really thinkabout her all that much.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:25"><subtitle>
I mean, obviously,I'm a fan of her early workwhich both satirizedand celebratedyouth culture's obsessionwith sex,but I do wonderas a third-wave feministif it's even possible for womento reclaim their sexualityin this deeply entrenchedpatriarchal society,or if claiming to do sois just a lie we tell ourselvesso we can more comfortably caterto the male gaze.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:43"><subtitle>
- Uh, what?- But you know,on the other hand, I worrythat conversations like this oneoften dismiss her as a merepuppet of the industry...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:49"><subtitle>
- That's my same worry.- ...incapable of engaging</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:51"><subtitle>
- in these discussions herself...- Obviously.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:54"><subtitle>
...and infantilization,which is itself a product</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:56"><subtitle>
- of the deeply misogynistic...- So deep.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:57"><subtitle>
...society we live in.But like I said,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:59"><subtitle>
I don't really think about herall that much.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:01"><subtitle>
Okay, well,that is very interesting,but I was more asking,like, what do you thinkabout her living here?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:07"><subtitle>
Oh, right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:08"><subtitle>
Well, what wasyour relationship likewith her when you were workingon the show?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:13"><subtitle>
It was very good,very professional.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:15"><subtitle>
BoJack,where did you go to college?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:18"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:14:14"><subtitle>
No, Diane,I'm just helping out a friend.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:16"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:37"><subtitle>
Oh, hey, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:39"><subtitle>
I told my friends they couldtear this wall out to builda sweet cocaine booth/sexcloset.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:43"><subtitle>
- Is that cool?- No, that's not cool.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:45"><subtitle>
Oof. Way to harsh the vibe,Kissinger.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:47"><subtitle>
Oh, I'm sorry.I didn't realize.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:50"><subtitle>
I thought this was a placewhere Sarah Lynncould finally be Sarah Lynn,but I guess...that's too much, man.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:58"><subtitle>
I always lovedthat catch phrase.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:01"><subtitle>
Can your friends at least takethe artwork off the wall first?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:04"><subtitle>
Ooh.I want to say yes, but no.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:08"><subtitle>
- Okay, good talk.- Wha-- Are you serious?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:16"><subtitle>
The reason I have calledthis house meeting is--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:19"><subtitle>
Todd, how many timeshave we been over this?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:21"><subtitle>
You don't have the authorityto call house meetings.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:23"><subtitle>
Only I can call a house meeting.You can propose a house meeting.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:27"><subtitle>
All right, fine, fine, fine,but the reason I propose</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:29"><subtitle>
- this house meeting--- Your proposal has beensubmitted andis under board review.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:33"><subtitle>
- Proposal denied.- BoJack, this Sarah Lynn thingis getting out of control, okay?She's taking advantage of you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:39"><subtitle>
What? No she's not.We have a special relationship.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:41"><subtitle>
You couldn't possiblyunderstand.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:43"><subtitle>
Oh, my God. Look at whatshe's done to your house.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:45"><subtitle>
All right, look, I mean,I stepped on a needle earlier.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:48"><subtitle>
I think I'm addictedto heroin now,so now, that's probablygonna be a whole thing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:52"><subtitle>
I have to say,I agree with Todd.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:54"><subtitle>
You're not this girl's father,and you're not doing herany favors by refusingto set boundaries.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:57"><subtitle>
Look, I played a dadfor nine years on TV,so I think I know a little bitmore about parentingthan you two jokers.The kids on Horsin' Arounddidn't need boundaries.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:06"><subtitle>
All they needed wassome good, old-fashioned love.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:08"><subtitle>
BoJack!This is not a TV show, okay?</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:13"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:19"><subtitle>
Some good, old-fashioned love,and I'm gonna give it to her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

I'm gonna give it to herso... hard.</subtitle>
