</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:51"><subtitle>
Are you a Zoe or a Zelda?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:53"><subtitle>
Don't know what that means.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:54"><subtitle>
Well, I was talkingto Wayne.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:56"><subtitle>
- Who's Wayne?- I'm Wayne.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:57"><subtitle>
Wayne's writing an articleabout me for BuzzFeed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:00"><subtitle>
BuzzFeed?What'll they think of next?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:03"><subtitle>
Fun fact: Wayne is alsomy ex-boyfriend.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:06"><subtitle>
Ha! You're funny.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:07"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:10"><subtitle>
Wayne's writingan article about me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:12"><subtitle>
We're the same!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:14"><subtitle>
How could you think thatthat's the same?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:15"><subtitle>
My book will be in librariesfor hundreds of years.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:17"><subtitle>
Your BuzzFeed articlewill be crammed</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:19"><subtitle>
between an animated GIFof a cat falling asleep</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:21"><subtitle>
and a list of fun factsabout Legally Blonde.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:24"><subtitle>
Ha! Classic Zoe.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:25"><subtitle>
I still don't knowwhat that means.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:27"><subtitle>
Well, are you familiarwith Mr. Peanutbutter's House?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:29"><subtitle>
Do you mean his sitcomthat coincidentally</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:31"><subtitle>
had the exact same premiseas my sitcom?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:33"><subtitle>
Not the exact same.Mr. Peanutbutter's House featured a pair of twins,Zoe and Zelda.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:39"><subtitle>
Zelda was the sunny,fun-loving extrovert.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:42"><subtitle>
Look at my pumpkin,Mr. Peanutbutter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:44"><subtitle>
Pretty smile, Zelly-belly.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:45"><subtitle>
<description>audience</description> Aww...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:47"><subtitle>
Whereas Zoe was the smart,cynical introvert.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:49"><subtitle>
My pumpkin's throwing upbecause Halloweenencourages excessive consumptionof refined sugarat a time when obesity ratesare sky high.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:56"><subtitle>
Plus, Halloween costumes area gateway to casual racism.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:00"><subtitle>
Why don't I keep the knife,Zo-bo?</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:04:07"><subtitle>
Now, was the show's actingham-fistedand the writing moronic?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:10"><subtitle>
N-n-no?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:12"><subtitle>
Yes, but the Zoe/Zeldaparadigm rang true.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:15"><subtitle>
I believe everyone'seither a Zoe or a Zelda.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:18"><subtitle>
For example, Nixon was a Zoeand Kennedy, a Zelda.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:22"><subtitle>
Al Gore, Zoe.George W. Bush, total Zelda.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:25"><subtitle>
It's R2-D2 and C-3PO,Zooey and Emily Deschanel.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:29"><subtitle>
So Zooey's a Zoe?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:30"><subtitle>
No, Zooey's a Zelda.Emily's the Zoe.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:33"><subtitle>
What a crazy world.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:34"><subtitle>
So which one are you,BoJack?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:36"><subtitle>
I think I'm...above this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:38"><subtitle>
Said the Zoe.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:39"><subtitle>
<description>laughter</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:41"><subtitle>
Well, I think I'm a Zelda.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:42"><subtitle>
Or maybe you'rethe third kind of person,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:44"><subtitle>
whose only function is to drainthe energy and life forcefrom his host organism.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:48"><subtitle>
Come on, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:49"><subtitle>
Nah, he's right.I'm pretty much worthless.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:51"><subtitle>
See? You say somethingto someone enough times,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:53"><subtitle>
and eventually,he internalizes it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:55"><subtitle>
The system works.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:57"><subtitle>
I don't have a job,I don't have any prospects.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:59"><subtitle>
I probably won't ever finishthe rock opera I'm working on.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:02"><subtitle>
What?<description>laughs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:03"><subtitle>
Since when are youworking on a rock opera?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:07"><subtitle>
Oh, no.Why'd I ask that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:09"><subtitle>
Basically, it's Tommyby way of Cirque du Soleilset in space,with heavy erotic overtones,and the gripping psychodramaof a thrillerwith plenty of heartand more than a little humor.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:35"><subtitle>
Yeah, you're right.This was stupid.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:37"><subtitle>
I don't knowwhat I was thinking.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:39"><subtitle>
Well, guess I'll give upforever.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:41"><subtitle>
That's the spirit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:45"><subtitle>
Now, you have to understandthat as a port city,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:48"><subtitle>
Liverpool had unique access toall aspects of American culture,especially Blues music and itsunruly nephew, Rock and Roll.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:55"><subtitle>
I thought this story was aboutrunning into Paul McCartneyin the bathroomat the Golden Globes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:58"><subtitle>
It is. I thought you wouldappreciate some context.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:01"><subtitle>
Let's skip that onefor a minute.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:03"><subtitle>
Tell me about Todd.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:04"><subtitle>
Todd?What's to tell?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:06"><subtitle>
Five years ago, he found his wayinto one of my house partiesand never left.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:10"><subtitle>
And you've never asked himanything about himself?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:12"><subtitle>
I've asked him to get a job,I've asked him to move out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:14"><subtitle>
With a little encouragement,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:15"><subtitle>
I'll bet he couldreally flourish.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:17"><subtitle>
I mean, didn't you have anyonewho helped youwhen you were juststarting out?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:20"><subtitle>
Um, actually, no.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:21"><subtitle>
Todd clearly thinksthe world of you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:23"><subtitle>
Todd thinks the worldof Pop-Tarts.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:25"><subtitle>
Look, I get that helping otherpeople is not your thing, but--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:28"><subtitle>
What? I let Todd liverent-free in my stately manse.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:30"><subtitle>
I am his own personalMother Teresa.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:32"><subtitle>
But do you let him stay herebecause you're kindor just because you're terrifiedof being alone?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:36"><subtitle>
<description>laughing</description>That is insane!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:38"><subtitle>
I would love to be alone.That is all I want.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:42"><subtitle>
Mmm...if that werereally true,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:44"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:22"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:27"><subtitle>
Let's dig in.Where to start?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:30"><subtitle>
Okay, well, the headline is,I hate it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:32"><subtitle>
I hate everything about it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:33"><subtitle>
The premise is badand the execution is also bad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:35"><subtitle>
It's an irredeemable jumbleof shit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:37"><subtitle>
Tough but fair.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:39"><subtitle>
Ahem.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:40"><subtitle>
That said,I don't see whywe can't make somethingreally great here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:44"><subtitle>
Okay, thank you.I'll work on that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:46"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:48"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:50"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:51"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:52"><subtitle>
You're not eveninside of me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:53"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:59"><subtitle>
Okay, so you knowin the second act closerwhen the seekers of Newtopiaare in the Turbidians' dungeonand they learn their ship</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:05"><subtitle>
- has been destroyed?- No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:06"><subtitle>
Well, what if we move thatto the fourth act?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:09"><subtitle>
I have no ideawhat you're talking about,but that idea is terrible.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:12"><subtitle>
I hear the note.Let me see what I can do.</subtitle>

So?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:26"><subtitle>
How can I put this?</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:09:27"><subtitle>
Imagine if the Holocausthappenedevery four yearslike the Olympics.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:32"><subtitle>
I would rather that happenedthan your rock opera.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:35"><subtitle>
That's not really a note.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:37"><subtitle>
In fact, none of your noteshave been notes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:40"><subtitle>
I feel like you'renot even listening.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:42"><subtitle>
Yeah, well, you know what?Maybe I would listenif the Turbidianshad some reasonto enterthe Cave of Swollen Dreamsthat didn't break the pactthey made in act onewith Queen Darneesa.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:51"><subtitle>
You have been listening.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:52"><subtitle>
Just doesn't make sense.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:53"><subtitle>
The Turbidiansare a loyal people.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:55"><subtitle>
They-- they wouldn'tbetray their queen.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:57"><subtitle>
Unless...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:00"><subtitle>
<description>both</description> They were workingfor Queen Darneesa,who gave them a potionthat would counteractthe effects ofthe Elixir of Failed Remembranceso they could bringthe secret knowledgefrom the cave back to her,and then establish Newtopiaas a vassal stateto the Craterman kingdom!</subtitle>
