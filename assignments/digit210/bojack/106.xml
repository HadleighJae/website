</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:32"><subtitle>
I-- I don't know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:34"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:37"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:12:39"><subtitle>
Because I've had, like,seven or eight coffees.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:41"><subtitle>
I mean, I admit,it's been bad for ideas,but it's been greatfor camaraderie.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:45"><subtitle>
Couldn't agree more.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:46"><subtitle>
Ooh, hey.What time is it?</subtitle>

You know, the guywhose showinvented thetwo-dates-to-the-prom story.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

You may have invented it, butI think our show perfected it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:29"><subtitle>
The only thingyou ever perfected</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:30"><subtitle>
- was stealing my thunder.- Stealing your thunder, eh?</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:34"><subtitle>
You know, it's tough.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:35"><subtitle>
I agree with the Latin Kingson social issues,but fiscallyI'm more of an Aryan.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:40"><subtitle>
Well, juggling bothnever ends well.</subtitle>
