</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:40"><subtitle>
Yeah, this whole storyisn't how it really happened.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:42"><subtitle>
Right...because of the shirts.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

<timestamp time="00:10:04"><subtitle>
Mr. Peanutbutter is annoyingthe shit out of me,and there's too much honeydewin the fruit bowl.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:07"><subtitle>
Blech. Honeydewis garbage fruit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:09"><subtitle>
Also, why is BoJackbeing played by an old, nebbishyfive-foot-tall bald guy?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:12"><subtitle>
Is that how the world sees me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:13"><subtitle>
Oh, I see.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:14"><subtitle>
So I can playVanya on 42nd Street,but I'm not a deft-enough talentto capture the essenceof the elusiveBoJack Horseman.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:22"><subtitle>
So sorry to offend you, sir.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:26"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:38"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:40"><subtitle>
I sabotaged his rock operaby getting him readdictedto a video game becauseI didn't want him to move out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:44"><subtitle>
Jesus Christ, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:46"><subtitle>
Anyway, I think he knowsand might be plottingto sabotage me back.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:50"><subtitle>
Why is it that 90%of our conversationsthese days revolve aroundplotting sabotages?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:54"><subtitle>
Are you saying I shouldplot a countersabotage?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:56"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:06"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:07"><subtitle>
Apparently some dickweednamed Todddecided I should bethree-dimensionaland you should have no lines.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:14"><subtitle>
Ugh. Isn't this town sickof creatingthree-dimensional rolesfor women?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:18"><subtitle>
This happens to meall the time!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:20"><subtitle>
A.O. Scott is sick of talkingabout how brilliant I am.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:23"><subtitle>
Todd.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:26"><subtitle>
I guesswhat I've been sayingfor the lastseven uninterrupted minutes is,how can I forgive my fatherif I can't forgive myself?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:34"><subtitle>
True dat.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:36"><subtitle>
But none of that matters,because we bring outthe best in each other.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:41"><subtitle>
I'm the chocolate,and you're Mr. Peanutbutter!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:46"><subtitle>

- Oh, my God, I'm so--- Ugh, what kind of idiotputs food on top of a hill?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:57"><subtitle>
Hey, so I guess now thatthe movie's all about Diane,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:00"><subtitle>
I really need to dig deepand get to know the real you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:03"><subtitle>
So let's talk and talkand talk until I am youand you are nothingbut a hollowed-out huskof your former self and everythought and every feelingyou ever had belongs to meand me alone.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:15"><subtitle>
So do we like Sprite,or are we more of a 7-Up girl?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:19"><subtitle>
Uh, that all sounds great.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:22"><subtitle>
But, you know, the personyou should really be talking tois that guy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:26"><subtitle>
- Yeah, okay, I'm done.- Diane loves talking to him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:28"><subtitle>
They have great rapport.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:30"><subtitle>
In fact, Diane could spendall day talking to himand never talk to me again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:36"><subtitle>
Oh, I get it, because Dianedoesn't talk to Diane.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:41"><subtitle>
- Diane talks to--- Anybody else.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:44"><subtitle>
Hey, Todd,remember that timewhen you wouldn't cleanup your shit?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:47"><subtitle>
That was hilarious.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:48"><subtitle>
- We've had some good times.- Oh. Hi.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:50"><subtitle>
So I was thinking,I have some...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:52"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description> pretty sloppy secondsleft over from P.F. Chang'sin the fridge, and I don't thinkthat I want it anymore.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:58"><subtitle>
Maybe tonight you could eat it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:59"><subtitle>
Friendly gesturebecause we're friends.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:01"><subtitle>
- Uh...- Oh-oh, there's my guy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:03"><subtitle>
I heard you had a few morethoughts about the script.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:05"><subtitle>
I do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:06"><subtitle>
I was just thinking, what ifwe made the BoJack characterinto a real shithead?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:11"><subtitle>
- Is that really necessary?- I don't think it's necessary.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:13"><subtitle>
Yeah, let's-- Let's make himbe a real selfish assholeso the audience has someoneto root against.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:19"><subtitle>
You're probably right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:20"><subtitle>
Let's take another swingat the scriptand give BoJack more to do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:23"><subtitle>
Now, when you say,"Give BoJack more to do"--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:25"><subtitle>
Not now, Mr. Peanutbutter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:26"><subtitle>
And also,now that I'm thinking about it,why does the moviehave to take place on Earth?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:32"><subtitle>
You are blowing my head.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:35"><subtitle>
- I hope you like Oscars.- Honeydew?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:37"><subtitle>
More like,"Honey, do I enjoy eating it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:39"><subtitle>
Yes, I do." Right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:41"><subtitle>
Not right, and I would love togo through all the reasons why,but I've got bigger concernsright now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:44"><subtitle>
- Honeydew, go on.- Did you noticethat the Mr. Peanutbutter parthas been cut in half?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:48"><subtitle>
- What is happening to our movie?- I thought you hated the movie.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:51"><subtitle>
Yeah, I do, but if I'mgonna be in a dumb movie</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:53"><subtitle>
I hate that makes no sense,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:54"><subtitle>
I should at leastbe the star of it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:56"><subtitle>
Look, I agree that this moviehas really lost its way.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:00"><subtitle>
I mean, first of all,why would Mr. Peanutbutterwear a crew neck T-shirt?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:04"><subtitle>
And second of all, uh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:06"><subtitle>
It's just the shirt,isn't it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:08"><subtitle>
It doesn't make sense.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:09"><subtitle>
I'm a V-neck man.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:10"><subtitle>
A V you can putyour sunglasses in.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:12"><subtitle>
Can you dothat with a crew neck?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:14"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:59"><subtitle>
referred to their parentsas 'a bunch of used jizz bags.'</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:02"><subtitle>
He filled the air with words,terrified of silence,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:05"><subtitle>
as one often is who is smartenough to recognize</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:51"><subtitle>
Oh, hi, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:52"><subtitle>
This whole day'sbeen a shit show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:54"><subtitle>
The book turned outto be a total hatchet job.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:56"><subtitle>
The movie's a disaster.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:57"><subtitle>
But thank God I have onegood thing in my life,and that's you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:01"><subtitle>
BoJack, I--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:02"><subtitle>
Please let me say thisbefore I lose my nerve.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:04"><subtitle>
I spent 50 years roamingthe countrysideas a wild stallion,but I am tired of the rodeo,and I'm finally readyto saddle up.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:11"><subtitle>
BoJack--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:12"><subtitle>
I guess what I'm tryingto say is,this mustang wants to resthis head in the comfortsof your spacious barn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:17"><subtitle>
Uh, what?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:18"><subtitle>
I'm in love with you, Naomi.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:20"><subtitle>
BoJack, they fired meand replaced mewith a ball on a stick.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:24"><subtitle>
I'm so sorry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:25"><subtitle>
But look at the bright side.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:27"><subtitle>
Now you and I can just hang outand talk about feelings.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:29"><subtitle>
No, but you're not getting it.Boys never get it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:32"><subtitle>
BoJack, I was in characteras Diane,and as Diane,we had a real connection.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:38"><subtitle>
But now that I'm off the movie,I'm Naomi again,and Naomi is not interestedin BoJack Horseman.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:44"><subtitle>
In fact,she thinks he's kind of gross.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:47"><subtitle>
So I didn't fall in lovewith Naomi Watts?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:49"><subtitle>
No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:50"><subtitle>
You fell in love with Diane.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:52"><subtitle>
Naomi what?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:54"><subtitle>
Good-bye, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:56"><subtitle>
Ugh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:57"><subtitle>
See?Nothing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:03"><subtitle>
What's going on?Why are they packing up?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:04"><subtitle>
Oh, glad you're here.This is exciting.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:07"><subtitle>
Since we last talked,this film has gone through</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:08"><subtitle>
- so many permutations.- So many.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:10"><subtitle>
First, we reimaginedthe whole filmas an interactivesocial-media experience.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:15"><subtitle>
Those are the dumbest wordsI've ever heard.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:16"><subtitle>
I know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:17"><subtitle>
So we realized it was actuallymore of a floatingart installation,but thatdidn't feel right either.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:23"><subtitle>
We thought,is it a high-end perfume?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:24"><subtitle>
A series of interrelatedfortune cookies?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:26"><subtitle>
A hat that if you turn itupside down, it's a boat?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:29"><subtitle>
- No, it's none of those things.- Exactly.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:32"><subtitle>
That's why we finallysettled on this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:34"><subtitle>
Voilà!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:35"><subtitle>
What am I looking at?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:37"><subtitle>
<description>Todd</description> It is a bimonthly curatedbox of snacks.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:40"><subtitle>
I don't know what that means.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:41"><subtitle>
I know.It's confusing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:43"><subtitle>
Not the bimonthlythat means twice a month,the bimonthly thatmeans every other month,and each timeit's a different box of snacks.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:50"><subtitle>
This is the future of cinema.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:52"><subtitle>
You guys, finally,my story has been told.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:56"><subtitle>
Okay, that's a wrap, everyone.<description>claps hands</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:59"><subtitle>
Thanks for makingthis box of snacks a reality.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:02"><subtitle>
Let's go home.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:05"><subtitle>
What the hell happenedto the movie?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:08"><subtitle>
Shit, there were snacks herethe whole time?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:11"><subtitle>
Not bad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:12"><subtitle>
- Whoa!- Look, I get it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:14"><subtitle>
You destroyed my big chanceat a comebackas revenge for what I didto your rock opera.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:18"><subtitle>
Revenge? Oh, that would havebeen such a good idea.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:21"><subtitle>
Damn it, Todd!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:23"><subtitle>
Look, I figured outwhat you did,but I've been trying to put itbehind me and do my job.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:27"><subtitle>
So cutting my part downwas not about revenge?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:30"><subtitle>
No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:31"><subtitle>
And making BoJack the villainof your moviewas not a coded statementof your feelings about me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:36"><subtitle>
No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:37"><subtitle>
Oh, okay, great.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:39"><subtitle>
Well, I'm-- I'm gladwe buried the hatchetand everything's cool.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:42"><subtitle>
Uh, actually, you know,everything is not cool.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:46"><subtitle>
You ruined my rock operaby using character actress</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:48"><subtitle>
Margo Martindale to trick meinto playingan addictive video game.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:52"><subtitle>
And saying it all togetherlike that,it all soundskind of ludicrous.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:55"><subtitle>
But still, it was somethingI cared about,and what you didreally hurt me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:01"><subtitle>
Oh.Well, this feels shitty.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:03"><subtitle>
You sure you don't want to justget some revenge real quick--thump me once in the stonesand then we'll be even?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:08"><subtitle>
I got to go.</subtitle>
