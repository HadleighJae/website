</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:16"><subtitle>

Why do you love Secretariat?</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:42"><subtitle>
No, because he was flawed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:44"><subtitle>
BoJack, when people findout that someone like you,who seems larger than life,is actually just as woundedand vulnerable as they are,it makes them feel less lonely.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:53"><subtitle>
Ugh, no!Maybe that's what flawed,sad fatties wantfrom other celebrities,but for BoJack Horseman,they want a heroic horse-studwho is awesomeand who can save them fromtheir flawed, sad, fatty lives.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:04"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:23"><subtitle>
to impress mewith material items.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:25"><subtitle>

The color is, um-- This one theydon't even have a name for,that's how exclusive it is,and this--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:34"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:05:39"><subtitle>
heiress to the SugarmanSugar Cubes fortune</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:41"><subtitle>
and used to certain comforts,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:43"><subtitle>
and his working-class father,Butterscotch Horseman,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:45"><subtitle>
who struggled, and often failed,to provide those comforts.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:48"><subtitle>
