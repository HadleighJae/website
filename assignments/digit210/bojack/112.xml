</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:12"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:15"><subtitle>
"SecretariatUnder Investigation."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:17"><subtitle>
What am I supposed to dowith that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:19"><subtitle>
Maybe it'sa different Secretariat.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:21"><subtitle>
Ha ha ha ha. No,but seriously, folks,there is no truthto these allegations.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:26"><subtitle>
I have never bet onhorse racing,and I certainly did not bet onmy own races.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:31"><subtitle>
Although I did bet the network'sgonna give your showback to Joey Bishop.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:34"><subtitle>
O-- ho ho-- kay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:36"><subtitle>
We get letters here on the show,and one particular letter,for you, actually, strucka chord with our producers.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:42"><subtitle>
This is from BoJack H.BoJack is nine years old.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:45"><subtitle>
BoJack writes,"Dear Secretariat,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:48"><subtitle>
I am a horse just like you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:50"><subtitle>
I like to watch racing,and you are my favorite racer."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:52"><subtitle>
Smart kid.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:54"><subtitle>
"When I grow up,I want to be just like you,and I thinkI'm on the right track.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:57"><subtitle>
Get it? Track,because horses run on tracks,and you are a horse,and I am a horse.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:02"><subtitle>
Do you get it? Do youget my joke about the track?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:04"><subtitle>
Okay, there'sa whole page of this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:06"><subtitle>
Should I write him backand tell him I get it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:08"><subtitle>
He goes on,"My question for you is,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:10"><subtitle>
I am a good kid,and I like to play,and I like to go to school,but sometimes I get sad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:16"><subtitle>
What do you dowhen you get sad?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:18"><subtitle>
How do you not be sad?Sincerely, BoJack."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:20"><subtitle>
That's a great letter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:22"><subtitle>
BoJack, when I was your age,I got sad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:25"><subtitle>
A lot.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:27"><subtitle>
I didn't come fromsuch a great home,but one day, I started running,and that seemed to make sense,so then I just kept running.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:35"><subtitle>
BoJack, when you get sad,you run straight aheadand you keep running forward,no matter what.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:42"><subtitle>
There are people in your lifewho are gonna try tohold you back, slow you down,but you don't let them.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:47"><subtitle>
Don't you stop running anddon't you ever look behind you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:49"><subtitle>
There's nothing for youbehind you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:51"><subtitle>
All that exists is what's ahead.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:47"><subtitle>
- Ssss.- Wow, that sounds amazing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:50"><subtitle>
But that's not usuallythe kind of thing I write about.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:53"><subtitle>
Diane, if you can make peoplecare about BoJack Horseman,surely you can make themcare about emaciated orphanswith missing limbs.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:03"><subtitle>
We need to wake people up.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:12"><subtitle>
Oh, yes, of course.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:16"><subtitle>
You want to spendthree months in Sudan?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:19"><subtitle>
Not just there. We're alsogoing to Haiti and Thailandand Uganda and Chechnya.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:23"><subtitle>
Can't you do all that in L.A.?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:25"><subtitle>
I want to do somethingimportant.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:27"><subtitle>
I want to help peopleand do good workand sleep on the groundand poop in a bucket.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:33"><subtitle>
Honey, nobody wants topoop in a bucket.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:36"><subtitle>
Maybe I do. MaybeI want to poop in a bucket.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:39"><subtitle>
If you want to poop in abucket, we can get you a bucket.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:41"><subtitle>
You don't have to go all the waythe Chechnylavakia.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:43"><subtitle>
Am I saying that right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:45"><subtitle>
It's not justthe pooping in a bucket.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:47"><subtitle>
I think it might be good for meto get out of L.A.for a little bit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:50"><subtitle>
Sweetie, you know I supportyou, whatever you want to do,but you're not gonna findwhat you're looking forin these awful made-up places.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:57"><subtitle>
The universeis a cruel, uncaring void.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:00"><subtitle>
The key to being happyisn't a search for meaning.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:02"><subtitle>
It's to just keep yourself busywith unimportant nonsense,and eventually, you'll be dead.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:07"><subtitle>
Well, I guessI can keep my options open.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:11"><subtitle>
Great.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:12"><subtitle>
<description>whistles gleefully</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:14"><subtitle>
Hey, can I ask you something?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:17"><subtitle>
Did Vincent seem extra weirdto you last night?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:21"><subtitle>
Well, he's still three kidsin a trench coat, so, no.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:24"><subtitle>
We're going through a roughpatch. It's hard, you know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:26"><subtitle>
He's works a full time jobat the business factory,so when he gets home,he just wants to unwindby watching R-rated movies.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:32"><subtitle>
Ahh, I thought I was readyfor a real adult relationship,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:34"><subtitle>
- but--- <description>snores</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:36"><subtitle>
Enough about me.BoJack, you are on fire.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:38"><subtitle>
Oh, are we talkingabout me again?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:40"><subtitle>
We have an offer on the tablefor you to play the bad guyin the new James Bond.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:44"><subtitle>
- Ehh.- I agree. Total garbage.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:47"><subtitle>
But this, it's a new dramafrom the Coen Brothers.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:49"><subtitle>
A western about a one-horse townand you're the horse.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:52"><subtitle>
Hello, Oscar. What do you think?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:54"><subtitle>
I think now's the timeto finally make "Secretariat."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:57"><subtitle>
Really? Now? Aren't youa little, um, very too old?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:00"><subtitle>
You asked me what I wantedto do. That's what I want.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:02"><subtitle>
That's all I've ever wanted,and if I can't get it now,then all of thishas been for nothing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:07"><subtitle>
Oh, fish. Of course!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:09"><subtitle>
Why would you evermake things easy for mewhen instead you could makethings incredibly difficult?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:13"><subtitle>
Laura, clear outthe rest of my day.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:15"><subtitle>
I have to push a boulderup a hill,and then have it roll over metime and time againwith no regardfor my well-being.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:22"><subtitle>
Attagirl.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:25"><subtitle>
All right, Todd. PB Livin'needs a new project.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:27"><subtitle>
Bi-Monthly Curated Box of Snackshas been an enormous success,but I got into this gameto make movies,so let's make a movie.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:34"><subtitle>
Well, I got a stackof great scripts here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:36"><subtitle>
Any one of themwould make a wonderful movie.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:38"><subtitle>
Fantastic.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:39"><subtitle>
But I also have this othernon-movie-related idea.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:44"><subtitle>
Ooh, let's hearthe other idea.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:45"><subtitle>
Okay. I washeading down Wilshire,and I saw this emptystore front, and I thought,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:50"><subtitle>
"You know whatthis world needs?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:52"><subtitle>
Edge of my seat over here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:54"><subtitle>
A store where people can buyHalloween stuff.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:57"><subtitle>
Halloween store.Feel like that's been done.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:00"><subtitle>
Yeah, in October,but how come your never seea Halloween store in January?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:06"><subtitle>
- It's an untapped market.- Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:08"><subtitle>
A Halloween storethat's open year-round.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:10"><subtitle>
- No, no. Just January.- Brilliant.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:13"><subtitle>
That's the kind of ideathat wins Golden Globes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:19"><subtitle>
I actually think the timeis right for "Secretariat,"so what do you want to play,like, Secretariat's dador his grandfather, maybe likean elderly witch doctorwho puts a curse on himor something?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:28"><subtitle>
Lenny, look, I knowI'm a little long in the tooth,but I think that youmore than anyonewould knownot to count out an old pro.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:34"><subtitle>
Don't play the ageism cardwith me, kid.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:36"><subtitle>
I've laid farts that lastedlonger than your entire career.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:39"><subtitle>
But Secretariat was dead at 27,so who we kidding here?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:42"><subtitle>
Just set the project upand give me an audition.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:44"><subtitle>
- That's all I ask.- All right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:45"><subtitle>
You got yourselfa "go" picture, kid.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:47"><subtitle>
And by you, I mean me.And by "go" picture,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:49"><subtitle>
I mean I'll make some phonecalls, we'll see what I can do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
