When did you get here?Sorry, no. Got it. Got it. Got it.</subtitle>

Man, these lights are bright, huh?</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:09"><subtitle>
Why didn't someone tell menot to trip over that cable?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:13"><subtitle>
It was such an important job,but no one was there to do itand now my face is in ruins.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:19"><subtitle>
We're gonna need a couple of daysto rebuild this set.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:12:52"><subtitle>
That's your takeaway?That your son's TV show wasn't Ibsen?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:56"><subtitle>
I'm sorry. Did you need a compliment?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:58"><subtitle>
Oh, I loved the part where you gotyour head caught in the banister.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:02"><subtitle>
- Yeah--- And what's this letter I have?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:04"><subtitle>
It's from the government saying,"I'm proud of you."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:07"><subtitle>
- Are you--?- No, what I'm holding is nothing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:10"><subtitle>
Can you check on our drinks?I would love some gin.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:13"><subtitle>
I wouldn't drink anything out of an opencontainer. This town is full of AIDS.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:17"><subtitle>
- That's not--- You're a clown, you know that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:19"><subtitle>
You've always been a pillar of support.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:21"><subtitle>
Gin, please? Is there gin coming?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:23"><subtitle>
I'm here, aren't I?I suffered through that ordeal.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:25"><subtitle>
You know, the man sitting next to mewas wearing a T-shirt?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:28"><subtitle>
A T-shirt, BoJack, in the theater.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:31"><subtitle>
Yes, a T-shirt.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:32"><subtitle>
Worst thing that's happened to anyonein a theater.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:35"><subtitle>
- The T-shirt told me to "just do it."- Here we go.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:38"><subtitle>
I don't know to what "it"the T-shirt referredbut I won't be spoken to in that toneby an article of clothing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:44"><subtitle>
Vodka? Triple sec?Looking for any alcohol.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:46"><subtitle>
You don't know how lucky you are.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:48"><subtitle>
I hope you die before I do so you neverknow what it's like to lose a mother.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:52"><subtitle>
As long as one of us dies,that's good enough.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:54"><subtitle>
Can we please get some alcoholinto my mouth?</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:13:59"><subtitle>
<description>man on recording</description>The past is past.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:14:01"><subtitle>
That's why it's called the past.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:04"><subtitle>
Tomorrow is an opportunity.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:06"><subtitle>
You can be big and proudand bang on your tom-tom drum</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:10"><subtitle>
or you can get in your boat and row.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:14"><subtitle>
Tom or row.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:16"><subtitle>
Tomorrow.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:14:17"><subtitle>
- Hey, do you wanna talk?- Talk? Why? Why would we do that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:20"><subtitle>
So you can put everythingin a book and sell a million copies?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:23"><subtitle>
Wow. Uh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:25"><subtitle>
That's what the old me would have said.The new me doesn't hold a grudge.</subtitle>

<description>phone rings</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:28"><subtitle>
- No.- I gotta say,the new you seems a little on edge.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:33"><subtitle>
What? Me?I'm as cool as The Fonz in a meat locker.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:35"><subtitle>
That's a metaphor, Diane.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:37"><subtitle>
- It's a simile.- Goddamn it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:39"><subtitle>

Oh, okay. Hello?</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:14:44"><subtitle>
- I heard you're blowing it.- What? Who told you that? Was it Todd?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:48"><subtitle>
You gotta turn this ship around, BoJ.If you don't--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:50"><subtitle>
Hey, can you hold on a second?I'm getting another call.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:53"><subtitle>
Well, if it isn't my friend, Rutabaga,the boy prince of the 26th floor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:58"><subtitle>
Carolyn.How are things all the way up on 27?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:02"><subtitle>
Stomp once for good, twice for killing it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:06"><subtitle>
Killing...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:08"><subtitle>
Give me some gossip.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:10"><subtitle>
My wife is making me goto the opera tonight.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:12"><subtitle>
I need something to distract mefrom the thought of D-bagssinging songs in Germanabout their boners.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:18"><subtitle>
Okay, you gottakeep this close to the vestbut I am inchesfrom getting Emily VanCampthe lead in Goose Van Sant'snew movie about Jackie O.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:27"><subtitle>
My clients would f-l-ipif I got them parts like that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:32"><subtitle>
You're killing itin the department of kicking assin regards to you being an agentand being good at it, crushing it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:38"><subtitle>
You're not so bad yourself, Rutabaga,for a 26er. <description>chuckles</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:41"><subtitle>
You're the only one in this buildingwho isn't a total snooze-cooze.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:45"><subtitle>
Yes, Natasha, I'm talking about you.I know you're listening.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:49"><subtitle>
Ugh. I gotta go. I made Natasha cry.</subtitle>

<description>chuckles</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:54"><subtitle>
I don't think she's coming back.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:56"><subtitle>
Could we keep it downin the front, please?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:59"><subtitle>
- Thank you.- What am I gonna do?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:01"><subtitle>
Well, you were an actor for nine yearson Horsin' Around. How did you do that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:06"><subtitle>
Uh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:07"><subtitle>
- Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?- Of course, buddy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:16"><subtitle>
<description>stomping overhead</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:17"><subtitle>
Hey, enough with the stomping already!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:21"><subtitle>
- Am I-- Am I a clown?- Oh, brother.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:25"><subtitle>
Didn't I tell you not to invite your momto the taping?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:27"><subtitle>
As Max Headroom would say,"Your m-m-mom is a b-b-bitch." <description>chuckles</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:32"><subtitle>
But I am a good actor, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:34"><subtitle>
BJ, I don't know. Look--You know what you're good at?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:38"><subtitle>
Hitting your mark, saying your lines,loudly with good diction.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:42"><subtitle>
Should I be doing more?To capture the character</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:44"><subtitle>
- and make the audience connect?- This is a situation comedy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:48"><subtitle>
No one watches this show to feel feelings.Life is depressing enough already.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:52"><subtitle>
You bring joy to millions of people.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:54"><subtitle>
Maybe someday later,you'll need to learn how to act for real.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:58"><subtitle>
But for now,<description>chuckles</description> don't worry about it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:02"><subtitle>
Oh, shit. I'm not an actor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:06"><subtitle>
All this time, I assumed there was moreto me than everyone thoughtbut maybe there isn't.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:12"><subtitle>
That's the part where you're supposedto disagree with me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:14"><subtitle>
Oh, right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:16"><subtitle>
Well, you got the part, didn't you?What did you do in the audition?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:20"><subtitle>
Well, how should I know?That was the old me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:22"><subtitle>
Now I've got a brand-new attitude.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:25"><subtitle>
Oh, God. Okay. Okay.What should I do?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:28"><subtitle>
Make a break for it? Drive to Mexico?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:30"><subtitle>
Start a new life there?Meet a local girl? Fall in love?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:33"><subtitle>
Talk my way into a job at a textile plant?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:35"><subtitle>
Work my way up until I own the place?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:37"><subtitle>
What am I talking about?I can't run a textile plant.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:39"><subtitle>
Too much responsibility. What am Igonna do? The walls are closing in!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:43"><subtitle>
BoJack, breathe. You can do this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:46"><subtitle>
You have two days.Maybe you could hire an acting coach.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:49"><subtitle>
- Yeah?- Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:50"><subtitle>
Plus, you can watch oldSecretariat videos.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:53"><subtitle>
I've got a hard drive full of research.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:55"><subtitle>
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.You're right. I can do this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:58"><subtitle>
I've got two whole days.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:00"><subtitle>
And when the pressure's on,that's when I shine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:03"><subtitle>
Yeah. Two days.I can do all those things.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:08"><subtitle>
Oh, shit. I didn't do any of those things.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:14"><subtitle>
- What are you doing here?- Ah!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:16"><subtitle>
That was it. Say that again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:18"><subtitle>
<description>campy</description> What are you doing here?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:20"><subtitle>
- Okay.- No?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:21"><subtitle>
BoJack, before we get started</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:23"><subtitle>
- I wanted to show you this.- What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:25"><subtitle>
This is the machinethat's gonna make you a good actor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:27"><subtitle>
- Really?- No. We need to make a scan of your faceso that if you die,we can finish the movie.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:33"><subtitle>
Standard procedure. When a staris assessed to be of a certain liability,like if there was a whole book writtenabout what a reckless jackass he is,you make a digital replica so you'renot screwed if he goes all Belushi on you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:45"><subtitle>
- Wait, which Belushi?- Hold still, please.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:48"><subtitle>
<description>whirring</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:50"><subtitle>
- Terrific. We got it.- One day, that's gonna be the job.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:53"><subtitle>
Sit for five secondswhile a machine scans his face.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:56"><subtitle>
Six months later,plugging a movie on Kimmel.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:58"><subtitle>
I gotta go on Kimmel now?What if he makes me read a mean tweet?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:01"><subtitle>
I'm not emotionally prepared.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:03"><subtitle>
Don't worry so much.If you can't do this partwe'll just fire you and get someone elsewho can. Either way, I'll be fine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:10"><subtitle>
- <description>groans</description>- What do you need, BoJack?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:12"><subtitle>
I don't know. I thought I wanted this,but now I'm feeling all this pressure.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:16"><subtitle>
- Think you made a mistake, hiring me?- I don't make mistakes, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:20"><subtitle>
I do the crossword in Sharpie,I never learned the shortcut for undo.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:23"><subtitle>
- Command-Z.- Don't need it, won't use it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:26"><subtitle>
I'm trying to have this new attitude,be this better, more positive guy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:30"><subtitle>
I keep thinking about how this movieis my last shot at happiness.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:33"><subtitle>
Well, BoJack, I hope this helps:</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:35"><subtitle>
I don't care if you are happy or not.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:39"><subtitle>
You have a job to do.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:19:51"><subtitle>
- Hey, Diane, you're a writer, aren't you?- Yes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:53"><subtitle>
Yes. I am a writer. What do you need?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:56"><subtitle>
Can you write on a sign"watch out for cable"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:59"><subtitle>
You were telling people,but it's a really important joband a sign is less likelyto get distracted.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:04"><subtitle>
Oh. Yeah. Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:07"><subtitle>
What are you doing here?</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:20:10"><subtitle>
What are you doing here?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:12"><subtitle>
- What are you doing here?- So, I went a little overboardand I made you two mixes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:17"><subtitle>
The first CD is all Mighty Mighty.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:19"><subtitle>
The second CD is all of the Bosstones'side projects and solo singles.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:22"><subtitle>
Listen to it and imagine the bandnever took that hiatusin the mid-aughtswhen America briefly lost interest in ska.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:28"><subtitle>
I don't have time.I don't wanna listen to your music.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:31"><subtitle>
I don't wanna hang out.Get out of here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:33"><subtitle>
<description>Mr. Peanutbutter chuckles</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:34"><subtitle>
All right. You don't wanna listento Bosstones together.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:37"><subtitle>
That's the impression that I get.</subtitle>

BoJack, listen, I know you're scared,but it's gonna be okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:57"><subtitle>
- You gotta be strong.- Yeah, but--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:59"><subtitle>
You gotta rise to the occasion, okay?So what if the new couch is weird?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:03"><subtitle>
- Or lumpy?- Uh, what?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:05"><subtitle>
What are you gonna do?Just sleep in BoJack's car forever?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:08"><subtitle>
