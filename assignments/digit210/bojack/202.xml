<timestamp time="00:00:11"><subtitle>
So, at the end of the day,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:12"><subtitle>
I'm just a regular guy tryingto live a regular life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:15"><subtitle>
Remember that time you peedin Drew Barrymore's car?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:18"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:00:23"><subtitle>
-You should do that to someone here.-What? No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:26"><subtitle>
Well, anyway, I can't believeI'm on a date with BoJack Horseman.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:29"><subtitle>
I feel like that anonymous girlfrom Chapter 8 of your bookmixed with the pluck and determinationof that anonymous girl</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:36"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:39"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:44"><subtitle>
-Uh... No.-Hey, this table's a little wobbly.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:47"><subtitle>
Want to yell at the waiterand make a scene?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:49"><subtitle>
-No, I don't need---Come on, do that BoJack thingwhere you make a big dealand everyone laughs,but at the same time we relate,because you're sayingthe things polite society won't.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:58"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:59"><subtitle>
-Is everything all right over here?-No, everything is not all right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:03"><subtitle>
This table's been wobbling all evening.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:05"><subtitle>
If I wanted to flop around and get seasickfor an hour, I'd call your mother.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:09"><subtitle>
-Something in that area or...?-Take me home nowand don't let me get out of beduntil I turn horse-colored.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:16"><subtitle>
-What are you doing?-Did you want me to stay?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:19"><subtitle>
No, I wanted you to leave more quietly.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:21"><subtitle>
Some of us here are tryingto forget you exist.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:23"><subtitle>
"Forget you exist."Classic BoJack. Love it.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:33"><subtitle>
Hey, Todd, can you drive meto get my car?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:35"><subtitle>
I wanted to be responsible last night,so I Ubered home</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:38"><subtitle>
-and left my car in the fountain.-Sorry, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:41"><subtitle>
I gotta get ready for my grand opening.It's finally happening. My Disneyland.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:46"><subtitle>
I realize that by saying "what"I might set off a chain of events</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:49"><subtitle>
whereby we continue this conversation,but what?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:52"><subtitle>
Well, remember when I first moved inand I kept asking</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:55"><subtitle>
-if we could go to Disneyland?-I do not.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:57"><subtitle>
And then you saidthat there was no Disneyland.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:59"><subtitle>
-No.-That Disneyland was a made-up lie,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:02"><subtitle>
like the tooth fairy, that parents useto get their kids to behave.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:06"><subtitle>
-Oh, yeah, that shut you up.-Sure did.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:08"><subtitle>
But then I thought,why isn't there a Disneyland?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:12"><subtitle>
People would love it!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:13"><subtitle>
So, I took matters into my own hands,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:16"><subtitle>
and over the last five years,I built my own Disneyland.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:19"><subtitle>
You've been doing this for five years?How have you never mentioned it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:23"><subtitle>
I bought that cheap plot of non-arabledirt by the toxic waste dump</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:27"><subtitle>
-up the hill from the old fire station.-Okay, Todd.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:30"><subtitle>
-I'm gonna build a Disneyland.-Sounds great, champ.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:33"><subtitle>
If it wasn't for that,she never would've gotten sober.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:36"><subtitle>
Just finished drawing up blueprintsfor that Disneyland I'm building.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:39"><subtitle>
Kind of busy here, Todd.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:41"><subtitle>
So, it turned out to be a good thingI peed in her car.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:43"><subtitle>

</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:50"><subtitle>
Hey, what's going on here?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:52"><subtitle>
You've been servedwith a cease-and-desist from my clients,the Walt Disney Company.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:57"><subtitle>
I wanted to make sure what we weredoing here was 100 percent legal,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:01"><subtitle>
-so I called a lawyer.-Wait, what?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:03"><subtitle>
As it turns out, it's not legal at all.Who knew?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:06"><subtitle>
-Mr. Peanutbutter.-We'll see you in court.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:10"><subtitle>
-The food court?-No. Regular court.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:13"><subtitle>
Okay. But also I'm hungry, so I mightjust stop by the food court first.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:20"><subtitle>
Let the record show, this is the singledumbest case I've ever adjudicated.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:25"><subtitle>
-Mr. Chavez?-Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:28"><subtitle>
I'm just gonna throw this out there.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:29"><subtitle>
Is it possible maybe when the other guystried to copyright the name Disneyland,they wrote down something elseby mistake,so "Disneyland" is still up for grabs?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:39"><subtitle>
Okay, well, let's have a lookat the Articles of Incorporation to seeif Walt Disney accidentally trademarkedthe wrong name. I'm sure these--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:49"><subtitle>
<description>stammers</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:50"><subtitle>
-What?-There's a typo. Di-isneyland.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:54"><subtitle>
With two "i"s. That son of a guntrademarked the wrong name.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:59"><subtitle>
May I, counselor?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:01"><subtitle>
D-I-I-S.This is unambiguous.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:04"><subtitle>
-I find in favor of the defendant.-Aw, shit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:08"><subtitle>
-You're the defendant.-Aw, sweet!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:11"><subtitle>
Your Otter, this is a gross miscarriageof justice.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:15"><subtitle>
Hooray! Gross miscarriage!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:21"><subtitle>
And that's how I turned my dream intowhat I call "The Happiest Place On Urf."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:27"><subtitle>
Urf is a made-up magical kingdomI added to the Disney canon.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:30"><subtitle>
-Americans, they like this theme park?-Oh, they love it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:34"><subtitle>
It represents everythingAmerica stands for.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:36"><subtitle>
Da.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:37"><subtitle>
-I mean, yeah.-We did it, buddy!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:40"><subtitle>
Actually, I did it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:42"><subtitle>
I had the idea to build a park,I did all the work and I beat the lawsuit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:49"><subtitle>
-Well, there's no "i" in "team," right?-But there is an "i" in "Disneyland."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:54"><subtitle>
And unlike that other Disneyland,this Disneyland only has one "i".</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:00"><subtitle>
What are you saying?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:01"><subtitle>
You're not welcomeat my theme park anymore.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:04"><subtitle>
There's only room for one goofy dog thereand his name is Pluto.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:09"><subtitle>
Todd, no.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:11"><subtitle>
I've told the beesif they see you to sting you on sight.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:14"><subtitle>
You understand. It's nothing personal.It's just good business.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:19"><subtitle>
And that's how we do business on Urf.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:22"><subtitle>
-I don't like you like this.-I learned it from you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:26"><subtitle>
If I could get everyone's attention.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:28"><subtitle>
You're probably wonderingwhy I invited you all here tonight.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:31"><subtitle>
You said it was to celebrateTodd's legal victory.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:34"><subtitle>
Right, but obviously,I don't care about that,so you're probably wonderingthe real reason.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:38"><subtitle>
<description>Princess Carolyn</description>No, we just took you at face value.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:41"><subtitle>
We have a special guest here tonight.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:43"><subtitle>
Alex. Or should I say "comrade"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:46"><subtitle>
<description>BoJack gasps</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:48"><subtitle>
-Why would you say "comrade"?-Oh, I forgot to explain that part.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:52"><subtitle>
Alex is a KGB agentbent on destroying America.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:56"><subtitle>
<description>all gasp</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:57"><subtitle>
-It truly is a small world after all!-Alex, is that true?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:00"><subtitle>
Okay, yes. It's true.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:03"><subtitle>
I was a deep-cover KGB operativebefore I went into my coma.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:07"><subtitle>
I've been trying to contactmy handler in Russia,but I can't reach himand I don't know if I ever will.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:12"><subtitle>
<description>all</description> Aww!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:13"><subtitle>
No! He's-- It's not adorable!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:16"><subtitle>
He's a soviet sleeper-agentwho doesn't realize the Cold War is over.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:20"><subtitle>
I felt totally alone in this worldbefore I met Wanda.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:23"><subtitle>
And then I met all of you, my friends.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:25"><subtitle>
But if you're gonna kick me to the curbjust because I thinkyou're all capitalist swineand want to see your wayof life destroyed, well, so be it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:33"><subtitle>
-Or should I say, So-vi-et.-Oh! Cute. Wordplay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:38"><subtitle>
-That's not even good wordplay.-Wait, how did you know all this?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:41"><subtitle>
-BoJack, were you spying on him?-He is literally a spytrying to destroy America,the country we all live in.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:48"><subtitle>
How am I the bad guy here?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:49"><subtitle>
BoJack, I am really bumping onthe whole you-not-liking-Alex of it all.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:54"><subtitle>
-You told me you were going to drop it.-Yeah, but--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:56"><subtitle>
I don't care about Alex.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:58"><subtitle>
I want to know what happenedto the amazing guy</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:00"><subtitle>
I spent the last few days with,because if this is who you are,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:04"><subtitle>
I don't think I like it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:05"><subtitle>
Alex, would you take me backto my sister's place?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:07"><subtitle>
Sure thing, Wanda.And I can get you there fastbecause I'm always Russian.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:12"><subtitle>
<description>all</description> Aww!</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:23"><subtitle>
Oh, I get what happened.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:25"><subtitle>
Could you get me a beer from the fridge?I didn't want to stand up.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:28"><subtitle>
Wait, no. I don't deserve beer.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:30"><subtitle>
You called me all the way over hereto not get you a beer?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:33"><subtitle>
Why do I always do this?I push away everyone I care about.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:36"><subtitle>
Oh, do you? I never noticed that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:38"><subtitle>
Look, you obviously really careabout this girland that scares you,so you sabotage yourself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:44"><subtitle>
That's my problem.I'm too good at sabotage.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:47"><subtitle>
-Why am I so good at everything I do?-Hey, I got a crazy idea.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:51"><subtitle>
How about you just stop sulkingand go win her back, dummy?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:54"><subtitle>
You're right. I gotta win her back,put it all on the line. You know what?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:58"><subtitle>
I think I will have that beer,can you get it for me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:01"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:02"><subtitle>
-Why do I bother?-Hey, grab a beer for yourself, too!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:05"><subtitle>
Actually, I want both beers!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:13"><subtitle>
-Wanda.-What do you want, BoJack?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:16"><subtitle>
There's something I gotta say.When I was--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:18"><subtitle>
-Todd! There's something I gotta say!-Hey, I'm kind of already doing--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:21"><subtitle>
I never should have triedto make your thing my thing!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:24"><subtitle>
I just got excited and wanted to smearMr. Peanutbutter all over everything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:28"><subtitle>
I should have been supporting you,like this support beam.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:34"><subtitle>
-Or a different support beam.-It's my fault.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:38"><subtitle>
The point of Disneyland isn'tto make money and win lawsuits.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:41"><subtitle>
But I forgot that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:43"><subtitle>
So, these two were so consumedby greed that it destroyed them.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:47"><subtitle>
You know, I came here todayto blow up Disneyland.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:49"><subtitle>
-You what?-But now I realize,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:51"><subtitle>
I don't need to take down capitalism.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:53"><subtitle>
Capitalism sows the seedsfor its own destruction.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
