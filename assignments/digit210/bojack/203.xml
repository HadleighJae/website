</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:12"><subtitle>
That's all right. I've learnedthat when you're in a loving familythere's nothing wrongwith a little horsin' around.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:19"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:38"><subtitle>
Great pilot.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:39"><subtitle>
We got the biggest laugh I ever heardwith that "gag me with a spoon" joke.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:42"><subtitle>
And then we topped itwith the "get a room" joke.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:45"><subtitle>
This was so fun.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:47"><subtitle>
Do we get to make more?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:48"><subtitle>
I think we got a real shot.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:50"><subtitle>
And as long as the ratings don't dipbelow a dismal 15 million a night,we could be on the air for many years.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:56"><subtitle>
-No way!-All right!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:57"><subtitle>
-Your Squirt, sir.-Thank you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:58"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:01"><subtitle>
No matter what,we're going to stick together.</subtitle>

Thank you, Tina,for those touching grunts and growls.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:19"><subtitle>
I'm Henry Winkler.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:20"><subtitle>
You probably remember mefrom my 2002 guest role</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:24"><subtitle>
on Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:26"><subtitle>
-Whoo!-Thank you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:27"><subtitle>
But perhaps the greatest roleI've ever played is friend.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:31"><subtitle>
Herb was a dear friendand I am honored to be dedicatingthis bench in his memory.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:39"><subtitle>
In his last days, Herb's cancerhad gone into remission.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:42"><subtitle>
He was full of hope.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:44"><subtitle>
But on the drive home from the hospital,his brakes gave out,he crashed into a truck full of peanuts.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:49"><subtitle>
He survived the crash,but he was allergic to peanuts.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:53"><subtitle>
He died instantly.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:54"><subtitle>
Let us now read his final tweets.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

<timestamp time="00:03:15"><subtitle>
I was wonderingwhere you wandered off to.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:17"><subtitle>
-Oh, shit. Hey.-Hey.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:19"><subtitle>
I'm no good with funerals.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:21"><subtitle>
When I cry, it messes up my makeupand then I get really bummed out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:25"><subtitle>
Yeah, same for me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:26"><subtitle>
Herb told me you cameby the house last summer.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:28"><subtitle>
Yeah?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:30"><subtitle>
Did he tell you anything else?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:32"><subtitle>
No, we talked about cancer,how hard it is living with cancer,about the L.A. Kings,and then back to cancer.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:37"><subtitle>
-Probably---Then I read that chapter in your bookabout how he never forgave youand he tried to kick you out of the house</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:43"><subtitle>
and you ended up wrestling on the floorover a telescope.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:45"><subtitle>
-Oh, you did read that part?-Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:48"><subtitle>
I just wishthere was something I could do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:52"><subtitle>
Okay, I gotta go.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:53"><subtitle>
Wait, I haven't seen you in 30 years.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:55"><subtitle>
You wanna go grab a cup of vodka?I-- I'm sorry, the funeral.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:58"><subtitle>
I mean, a bottle of vodka?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:00"><subtitle>
No. You should stick around.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:02"><subtitle>
Hey, maybe you'll findthat something you're looking for.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:05"><subtitle>
But if you're ever in New Mexico,drop me a line.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:07"><subtitle>
New Mexico?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:08"><subtitle>
I thought you lived in Maine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:10"><subtitle>
I always pictured you there.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:11"><subtitle>
A little house by a lake?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:13"><subtitle>
I was just there for, like, a month,30 years ago.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:15"><subtitle>
-I live outside Santa Fe now.-Oh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:26"><subtitle>
-<description>sighs</description> Think everyone here read my book?-I didn't.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:29"><subtitle>
Of course you didn't.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:31"><subtitle>
Here's the CliffsNotes version:Shut up, Todd!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:33"><subtitle>
Okay, you're clearly in one of your moods.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:35"><subtitle>
I'm gonna go play astronaut in the trunkof your car for the next few hours.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:39"><subtitle>
Have fun being sad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:41"><subtitle>
Do you know what you're supposed to dowith our date pits?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:44"><subtitle>
Why serve datesand not have a place to put the pits?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:46"><subtitle>
You know,some people just have no class.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:48"><subtitle>
What are you doing here?You didn't know Herb.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:50"><subtitle>
No, but I do know a hot ticket,and this funeral's a real whom's-whom.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:54"><subtitle>
Henry Winkler,Jake and Maggot Gyllenhaal,that Pakistani girlwho keeps winning Nobel Prizes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:59"><subtitle>
I'm gonna go rub me some elbows.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:01"><subtitle>
There's so much to hateabout what you just said.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:03"><subtitle>
Good news. You know when someone dies,everyone wants to buy their shit?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:07"><subtitle>
You're lucky you have a pieceof Horsin' Around,because this is where moneystarts rolling in.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:11"><subtitle>
I don't want that. That's blood money.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:13"><subtitle>
Well, what do you want me to do with it?It's coming.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:15"><subtitle>
I don't know. Give it to some orphans.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:17"><subtitle>
-I can't deal with this.-Oh, come on!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:19"><subtitle>
You don't think Elton Johnwas raking it in when Diana died?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:22"><subtitle>
More like "Candle in the Windfall."Cha-ching! Hmm...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:28"><subtitle>
<description>Herb</description> You have to live with the shittything you did for the rest of your life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:33"><subtitle>
Huh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:35"><subtitle>
<description>British accent</description> Hello, love.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:37"><subtitle>
Hey, Joelle,I actually came here to be alone.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:39"><subtitle>
I'm at my wit's end, I truly am.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:41"><subtitle>
I just flew in across the pondand I don't know which end is up.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:44"><subtitle>
This might be a stupid question,but were you always so... British?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:49"><subtitle>
Oh, let's get some light in here,it's so dreadfully dreary.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:52"><subtitle>
Because I'm, like, 70 percent sureyou used to be American.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:55"><subtitle>
That's better.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:56"><subtitle>
Hey, this one's having a freak-out.She needs to lie down.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:58"><subtitle>
I'm not freaking out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:00"><subtitle>
I just don't understandwhy that lady was being all judgy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:03"><subtitle>
You were touching her faceand telling her she was gonna die next.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:06"><subtitle>
I'm eccentric. I do weird shit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:09"><subtitle>
How is that my problem?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:11"><subtitle>
Hey, when was the last timeall four of us were in the same room?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:14"><subtitle>
Probably not since the show ended.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:17"><subtitle>
Yeah, I left Californiapretty much right after.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:19"><subtitle>
Now I got the biggest hardware storein Seattle.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:22"><subtitle>
That's a lie. We're actually in Olympia.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:24"><subtitle>
And I'm on the West Endplaying Juliet's... nurse.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:28"><subtitle>
-And how are your kids?-I don't have any kids.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:30"><subtitle>
Oh, I just assumedyou had a bunch of kids,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:32"><subtitle>
'cause, you know, your body.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:35"><subtitle>
Come on, Sarah Lynn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:35"><subtitle>
I assumedyou weren't still a massive cunt.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:38"><subtitle>
-Jesus Christ, Joelle.-That's an okay thing to say in England.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:41"><subtitle>
Shove it up your asswith a spoonful of sugar,you supercalifragilisticexpiali-bitch!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:46"><subtitle>
-Guys, hey, hey, come on.-Let go of me!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:48"><subtitle>
-I'm gonna hulk out!-Guys, can we just be civil for one day?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:51"><subtitle>
-Oh, you're one to talk.-What's that mean?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:53"><subtitle>
Were you being civilwhen you had sex with my mom?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:56"><subtitle>
What? I never-- Why would--? Wait, whichone was your mom? Blond hair? Glasses?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:59"><subtitle>
-No.-This sucks. You guys suck.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:02"><subtitle>
I don't even knowwhy I came to this party.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:04"><subtitle>
It's not a party, it's Herb's funeral.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:07"><subtitle>
Herb died?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:08"><subtitle>
You know, maybe it's for the bestwe don't get together that often.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:11"><subtitle>
We'd most likely drive each other mad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:13"><subtitle>
Well, no one knows how to getunder your skin like family.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:16"><subtitle>
We're not a family, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:17"><subtitle>
We probably won't even see each otheragain, until the next funeral.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:22"><subtitle>
-Why are you all looking at me?-You are the oldest.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:25"><subtitle>
You are a severe alcoholic.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:27"><subtitle>
I'm honestly so high right now,I don't even know where I'm looking.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:30"><subtitle>
Anyway, so long, thanks for the memories,and don't forget to suck a dick, dumbshi--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:36"><subtitle>
Pardon me. Is one of you Sarah Lynn?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:39"><subtitle>
I am. Of course. God, are you blind?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:42"><subtitle>
Yes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:43"><subtitle>
Well, forgive me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:44"><subtitle>
I'm Herb Kazzaz's blind executor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:47"><subtitle>
Per the instructions of his last willand testament, I am to give you this disk.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:54"><subtitle>
Am I close?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:55"><subtitle>
Just take the disk from the guy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:57"><subtitle>
It contains directions to Herb's gold.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:00"><subtitle>
Herb's gold?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:01"><subtitle>
There were no further details.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:03"><subtitle>
He was a peculiar client.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:05"><subtitle>
I told him, I'm not actually an attorney,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:08"><subtitle>
I'm just a blind man.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:09"><subtitle>
Still, Herb thought me wisefor some reason.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:12"><subtitle>
Perhaps it is my overly formalmanner of speech.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:16"><subtitle>
I bid you good day.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:19"><subtitle>
Oh, pardon me. Ow!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:21"><subtitle>
Right at shin level.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:22"><subtitle>
What are we supposed to dowith a floppy disk?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:25"><subtitle>
Hmm...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:26"><subtitle>
So, what's up, kiddo?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:27"><subtitle>
BoJack and my momare becoming, like, friendsand they're acting real weird.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:31"><subtitle>
Oof! Uh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:33"><subtitle>
<description>rattling overhead</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:34"><subtitle>
Hey, guys, guys, come on!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:36"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:38"><subtitle>
Jeez, all day with the...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:39"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:41"><subtitle>
You wanna check outthis cool new game I got?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:44"><subtitle>
You have solitaire? On your computer?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:47"><subtitle>
Yep. It only took 12 disks to install it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:49"><subtitle>
Wow!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:51"><subtitle>
Herb's computer had a floppy disk drive.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:53"><subtitle>
I bet it's still in his old office.Unless somebody else moved in.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:56"><subtitle>
Nobody wanted Herb's office, remember?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:58"><subtitle>
Because it was under tap dancing starSavion Glover's office. Let's go.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:02"><subtitle>
-What? Right now?-Yeah. Don't you get it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:05"><subtitle>
Herb's giving us a reunion special.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:06"><subtitle>
Remember how he always wanted to doa treasure hunt episode of Horsin' Aroundbut the network said it was too edgy?This is that episode.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:13"><subtitle>
-I just don't know.-Yeah, I don't want to do that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:16"><subtitle>
Wait, so you'd rather just stayat this funeral and be sad,instead of going on a crazy adventureto find our dead friend's secret treasure?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:23"><subtitle>
Do you have any ideahow insane you sound?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:25"><subtitle>
Oh, I get it.You just don't wanna be here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:28"><subtitle>
No, that's not it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:29"><subtitle>
Herb clearly wanted us to do this,as a family.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:32"><subtitle>
Who cares what he wanted?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:33"><subtitle>
He doesn't, because he's dead.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:35"><subtitle>
And we all know he hated your guts.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:37"><subtitle>
Yeah. He was my best friendand he died hating meand nothing I do is gonna change that,but Herb left you that diskbecause he wanted us to find his gold.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:44"><subtitle>
If we can honor Herb's last wish,then that's something.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:49"><subtitle>
I don't know what, but it's something.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:53"><subtitle>
-Okay. For Herb.-Fine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:55"><subtitle>
-Shotgun!-Everyone knows you can't call shotgun</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:58"><subtitle>
-before you see the car!-My turn! Get out of my way!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:00"><subtitle>
Brad, hang on one second.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:02"><subtitle>
Your mom wasn't redheaded twins, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:05"><subtitle>
-No.-Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:07"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:16"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:22"><subtitle>
Oh, God, I-- I'm so sorry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:24"><subtitle>
I'll let you get back to your business.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:27"><subtitle>
Hey, Winkly, such a shame, isn't it?About our friend Herb?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:32"><subtitle>
It really burns my brisketthat some people would turn a funeralinto some kind of schmoozefest.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:37"><subtitle>
Yeah. I know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:39"><subtitle>
Those other people are the worst.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:41"><subtitle>
I bet that woman barely knew Herb.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:44"><subtitle>
Anyway, hi, I'm Henry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:45"><subtitle>

</timestamp>

And when the mayor gave us the keyto the city,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:16"><subtitle>
Herb said, "Volunteering isn't about keys.It's about people."</subtitle>
</timestamp>

-How touching.-Good story.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:23"><subtitle>
-Who are you again?-Wow, that was touching.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:26"><subtitle>
A story that could never be topped.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:28"><subtitle>
Or could it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:29"><subtitle>

You really are a dweeb.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:56"><subtitle>
Don't say that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:57"><subtitle>
Whoa, who are you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:00"><subtitle>
Some kind of magical trash troll?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:02"><subtitle>
No. I'm a janitor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:03"><subtitle>
But I was clearing out someof the old stages,and I found this transformation chamber.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:09"><subtitle>
Looks like a bunch of old junk.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:11"><subtitle>
Let me tell you a story.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:13"><subtitle>
Back in the '90s, the biggest dweebof them all was Steve Urkel.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:18"><subtitle>
Oh, yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:19"><subtitle>
It was so funny how he never knewwhether or not he did that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:22"><subtitle>
Right.Well, nerdy Steve Urkel invented a machinethat transformed himinto the debonair Stefan Urquelle.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:30"><subtitle>
Mr. Janitor, you're standing nextto a machine right now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:35"><subtitle>
Yes. That's why I brought it up.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:37"><subtitle>
Now, this is just a prop.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:39"><subtitle>
But it represents a very powerful idea.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:42"><subtitle>
So if I go through that magic machine,I'll become cool and confident?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:47"><subtitle>
No, it's a-- It's a prop. I just said--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:50"><subtitle>
<description>inhales, exhales deeply</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:55"><subtitle>
-I feel different.-Now, son--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:58"><subtitle>
Todd? Who's Todd?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:00"><subtitle>
My name's Toad. Toad Chavay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:03"><subtitle>
And I gotta get my bubble on.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:05"><subtitle>
Machine? Squirt me. Hi-yah!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:11"><subtitle>
That'll do, machine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:18"><subtitle>
Hmm...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:20"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:38"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:40"><subtitle>
Herb's nurse is a bear.You think she knew about this gold?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:44"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:36"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:38"><subtitle>
I've been working on this novel.I wanna be remembered for something.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:42"><subtitle>
All I ever did was that stupid sitcomthat got ripped away from me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:45"><subtitle>
But now, with this book,I have something good.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:48"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:51"><subtitle>
-It's my Kazzaz-terpiece.-Whoa.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:54"><subtitle>
I want you to make sureit gets published after I die.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:58"><subtitle>
You can count on me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:59"><subtitle>
To life, huh? It'll kill you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:02"><subtitle>
Oh, my God, the gold is his manuscript.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:05"><subtitle>
Herb made me promiseto get it published after he died.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:08"><subtitle>
And you're just remembering this now?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:10"><subtitle>
Yeah, I'm remembering a lot of stuff.The ketamine's wearing off.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:14"><subtitle>
Oh, my God, you were the other kidon Horsin' Around.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:17"><subtitle>
That's why you've been following usaround all day.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:20"><subtitle>
So no one's read this bookexcept for Henry Winkler</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:24"><subtitle>
-and now the book is missing?-He must have been waiting for Herb to dieso he could steal the bookand publish it himself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:30"><subtitle>
But then when the cancer wentinto remission--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:33"><subtitle>
Oh, my God.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:34"><subtitle>
Guys, I don't thinkthat car crash was an accident.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:36"><subtitle>
I think Herb might have been murdered!</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:41"><subtitle>
What's going on?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:42"><subtitle>
Something about a merger?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:48"><subtitle>
My name's Toad, baby.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:58"><subtitle>
Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:00"><subtitle>
Coolsville, daddy-o.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:03"><subtitle>
Oh, lookie here.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:08"><subtitle>
Yo! That's my bike!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:11"><subtitle>
Oops. Did I do that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:16"><subtitle>
Damn. I know I should be mad,but that guy's just so cool.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:22"><subtitle>
And when the river finally stopped,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:24"><subtitle>
Herb went overto a poor little Ottawan boyand he said, "Son, you have water now."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:29"><subtitle>
You know, a lot of people go theirwhole lives and they never give a damn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:32"><subtitle>
But Herb? He gave those beavers a dam.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:36"><subtitle>
That was beautiful.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:38"><subtitle>
You clearly had a special relationship.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:41"><subtitle>
We were gonna sprinkle Herbover the ocean,but his resting place should besomeplace meaningful, don't you think?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:46"><subtitle>
Why don't you take this up to Ottawaand spread his ashes there.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:50"><subtitle>
And make sure you take a video,and I'll e-mail blast it to everyone here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:53"><subtitle>
So we can always rememberyour great friendship.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:56"><subtitle>
Everybody, stop!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:57"><subtitle>
Henry Winkler is a stone-cold killer!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:00"><subtitle>
<description>all gasp</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:01"><subtitle>
What? I'm not a killer.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:02"><subtitle>
Unless you mean killer of gloom,because I bring joy everywhere I go.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:06"><subtitle>
Did you mean "killer of gloombecause I bring joy everywhere I go"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:09"><subtitle>
You know that's not what I meant.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:11"><subtitle>
You murdered Herbso you could publish his book.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:14"><subtitle>
But we're not gonna let yousteal his legacy, Henry Winkler.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:17"><subtitle>
I was afraid this would happen.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:21"><subtitle>
-Oh, no, he's got a gun!-Oh, no!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:22"><subtitle>
