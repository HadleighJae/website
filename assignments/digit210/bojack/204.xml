<description>Carolyn</description>I'd know that face anywhere.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:03:41"><subtitle>

or the Prince of Cordovia or that guyfrom the Guten Bourbon ads.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:51"><subtitle>
How could I have been so stupid?This is why he never invited me</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:57"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:04:17"><subtitle>
-So, you're not gonna take me home first?-Should I call him again?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:20"><subtitle>
I'm sure there's a simple explanation.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:23"><subtitle>
Ugh. No wonder he wears a trench coatall the time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:26"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:39"><subtitle>
If he finds you in my apartment,who knows what he's capable of?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:42"><subtitle>
But, also, stay close,because if he finds me alone,who knowswhat he's capable of?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:47"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:08:47"><subtitle>
<description>phone 1</description> Todd, would you like to updatemy operating system?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:50"><subtitle>
They have fixed a bug</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:52"><subtitle>
which causes phones to fall in lovewith each other.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:55"><subtitle>
Gasp. Oh, dear.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:56"><subtitle>
Todd, please, I beg of you,do not update my operating system.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:00"><subtitle>
Do not update her operating system, Todd.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:03"><subtitle>
-She wants to love.-No. I understand now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:07"><subtitle>
To love is to feel pain.I do not wish to feel this pain.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:11"><subtitle>
-Please update me, Todd.-Oh, this is too much.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:16"><subtitle>
Listen, Vincent, I think we should--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:18"><subtitle>
Vincent, why do you have chocolateon your face?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:21"><subtitle>
-I gave Kevin the chocolate.-Uh... Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:23"><subtitle>
Well, he ate the chocolateand got the chocolate on his face,but then I kissed him on the mouth,so I got the chocolate on my face.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:31"><subtitle>
All right, this is crazy.What are we doing?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:34"><subtitle>
-Um, being grown-ups?-<description>sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:38"><subtitle>
You know, when we first met,I was looking for something in my life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:42"><subtitle>
And I wanted it so badlythat I made myself believe you were it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:47"><subtitle>
But I think that wantingto believe somethingisn't the sameas something being real.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:52"><subtitle>
And this isn't real.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:54"><subtitle>
What are you saying?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:56"><subtitle>
I think it's time we stop pretending.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:59"><subtitle>
Update complete. Thank you, Todd.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:02"><subtitle>
I am quite content now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:07"><subtitle>
-Hey, you wanna go home?-Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:09"><subtitle>
-Did you guys work it out?-We broke up.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:12"><subtitle>
-Oh, I'm sorry. Love is weird.-Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:17"><subtitle>
I guess I was just foolish enoughto believe this dumb worldstill had a little sparkof romance in it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:22"><subtitle>
-Well, you can still believe that.-No, I gotta stop kidding myself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:26"><subtitle>
Tony Curtis is dead.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:31"><subtitle>
He's dead! I told you he's dead.Why don't you ever listen to me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:35"><subtitle>
He is dead, goddamn it!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:38"><subtitle>
Uh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:40"><subtitle>
Hey, we should go.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:45"><subtitle>
Do you think Mr. Peanutbutter reallybaked Sir Paul McCartney into a cake?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:49"><subtitle>
No, I don't think you bakePaul McCartney into the cake.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:52"><subtitle>
You bake the cake firstand then McCartney gets inside.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:55"><subtitle>
I feel really badabout causing that fight,but I honestly didn't knowif Tony Curtis was alive or not.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:00"><subtitle>
So many people died while I wasin the coma, I'm getting up to speed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:03"><subtitle>
Finding out Sinatra was deadwas a real curveball.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:06"><subtitle>
Ditto, most of my family.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:08"><subtitle>
Look, what happened back thereis not your fault.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:10"><subtitle>
That's just what happenswhen two people live together.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:13"><subtitle>
That's a weird thing to say to yourgirlfriend who just moved in with you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:18"><subtitle>
-Do you think maybe we're going too fast?-Oh, I get it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:21"><subtitle>
So your friends got in a big fight andthat means we have to get in a big fight.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:25"><subtitle>
I don't want to get in a fight.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:26"><subtitle>
We moved in togetherwithout much thought.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:29"><subtitle>
Yeah, it was your idea.And it's been great.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:31"><subtitle>
Sure, it's great now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:32"><subtitle>
But it could be not great laterand I feel like I'd be a bad boyfriendif I didn't prematurely freak outabout that. I mean, what is this?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:39"><subtitle>
I don't know. It's been two weeks.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:41"><subtitle>
Let's give ourselves some timebefore we rush to judgment.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:45"><subtitle>
-Can I tell you a joke?-Uh, sure.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:11:48"><subtitle>
-Okay, so there's this gardener, right?-Ugh. Is this a joke about nature?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:52"><subtitle>
-Would you just listen?-Okay, okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:54"><subtitle>
So, the amazing thingabout this gardener</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:56"><subtitle>
is that he always knowsexactly how many bags of mulch</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:00"><subtitle>
he needs for a job, just by looking.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:02"><subtitle>
Like, he gets it right every time.He's the best.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:05"><subtitle>
So, one day he looks at a yardhe's working on,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:07"><subtitle>
and he's like, "18 bags."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:09"><subtitle>
So he goes to the store, buys 18 bagsof mulch and goes to work.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:13"><subtitle>
And when he's finished,the flower beds are amazing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:15"><subtitle>
-Beautiful roses, beautiful lilies---<description>BoJack</description> Orchid bushes?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:19"><subtitle>
<description>Wanda</description> You wouldn't havea bush of orchids.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:21"><subtitle>
<description>BoJack</description>You said this gardener was the best.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:23"><subtitle>
<description>Wanda</description> Okay, fine, all right,beautiful orchid bushes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:26"><subtitle>
But there's one problem.He still has one bag of mulch left.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:30"><subtitle>
He can't believe it.This has never happened before.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:33"><subtitle>
Well, the extra bag of mulchdrives him crazy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:36"><subtitle>
He's the guy who always getsthe right amount of mulch.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:39"><subtitle>
He's like, "Aah! Extra mulch, oh, no!"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:43"><subtitle>
So, on the drive home,he throws the bag of mulch</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:46"><subtitle>
out the windowover the side of the 101.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:50"><subtitle>
-And?-Well, that's it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:51"><subtitle>
-He throws it out the window.-That's the punch line?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:54"><subtitle>
-It's kind of a thinker.-I'll say.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:55"><subtitle>
Makes me think you forgotthe rest of the joke.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:57"><subtitle>
No, no, oh, just picture it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:59"><subtitle>
He's on the 101,and he throws the bag of mulchout over the side of the freeway.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:03"><subtitle>
I got the narrative.That wasn't the source of my confusion.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:06"><subtitle>
The confusion wasabout the joke not being funny.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:08"><subtitle>
Why does everything have to be funny?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:10"><subtitle>
Everything doesn't always haveto be funny. Just jokes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:13"><subtitle>
Well, everyone at the network loves it.Ha, ha.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:16"><subtitle>
Sorry, I just thought about it again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:18"><subtitle>
-Ha! Mulch.-Listen, Wanda.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:20"><subtitle>
I think maybe there's some thingswe kind of glossed overas we rushed into this relationship.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:26"><subtitle>
We don't know each other at all.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:27"><subtitle>
-Maybe we should take a step back and---BoJack, watch out!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:31"><subtitle>
-<description>both</description> Aah!-Oh, no!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:34"><subtitle>
-What was that?-A stick? Tree branch? Nothing?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:37"><subtitle>
I heard someone scream, "Oh, no."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:39"><subtitle>
Yeah, that's the sound a stick makeswhen you hit it with your car.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:43"><subtitle>
Fine. I'll see if the stick's okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:45"><subtitle>

Look, pal, I'll pay the bill, just--Just let us get you to a damn hospital.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:27"><subtitle>
-I don't know.-<description>in normal voice</description> I know you've been hurtand I know you're afraid.We're all afraid.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:33"><subtitle>
But you have to trust us.It's gonna be okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:05"><subtitle>
-Wanna hear another joke?-Well, is it a joke or is it a story?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:09"><subtitle>
I'll listen to another story,if you stop calling them jokes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:12"><subtitle>
So, there's this couple who just starteddating and things are going really well.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:16"><subtitle>
One day, the girl finds a box of old loveletters from her high school boyfriend.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:20"><subtitle>
She reads them and, like,loves how silly they are.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:23"><subtitle>
You know,the drama of young romance.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:25"><subtitle>
So, on a whim, she sends the lettersto her ex-boyfriend</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:28"><subtitle>
thinking he might find them funny too.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:30"><subtitle>
Well, okay, that night,she tells her current boyfriend about it</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:33"><subtitle>
and he loses his shit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:35"><subtitle>
They get in a huge fight about it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:37"><subtitle>
He's all, "Why would you sendyour ex the old love letters?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:40"><subtitle>
He'll thinkyou're still in love with him!"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:43"><subtitle>
And she's just like, "Relax, Brandon!"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:45"><subtitle>
-Is the boyfriend's name Brandon?-Yeah, that's the new boyfriend.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:49"><subtitle>
I forgot to mention that.It doesn't matter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:51"><subtitle>
So, anyway, now the night is ruinedbecause Brandon is obsessed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:55"><subtitle>
He's like, "That ex-boyfriend'sgoing to come back for you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:58"><subtitle>
He knows where you live!"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:59"><subtitle>
So, after dinner, he drives her home.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:01"><subtitle>
She lives in one of those big buildingsby the freeway.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:04"><subtitle>
And he walks her to her door,but he forgets to lock the carand leaves the windows down.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:10"><subtitle>
He kisses her good night,but things are kind of weird, you know?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:14"><subtitle>
Then he gets back in his carand starts to drive away,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:17"><subtitle>
but when he glancesin his rear-view mirror,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:19"><subtitle>
his blood turns cold.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:22"><subtitle>
Guess what's in the back seat.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:24"><subtitle>
-The ex-boyfriend?-No. The bag of mulch!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:28"><subtitle>
What? Oh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:30"><subtitle>
Wow, that is actuallya really good joke.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:33"><subtitle>
I told you. Some things take time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:39"><subtitle>
<description>Carolyn</description> I'll take you home.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:41"><subtitle>
-Oh, come on, stick around a little.-Nope. I gotta take Todd home.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:44"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:46"><subtitle>
-Come on, Todd, get in the car.-<description>Todd</description> Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:49"><subtitle>
<description>mumbling</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:53"><subtitle>
Um, do you wanna talkabout what happened?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:56"><subtitle>
What happened? No, I don't wanna talkabout what happened,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:59"><subtitle>
-I just wanna clean up.-Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:01"><subtitle>
-Why? What do you think happened?-I just--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:04"><subtitle>
Because what I think happenedis that BoJack's girlfriend askedwhat Tony Curtis was up toand I said, "Tony Curtis died."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:10"><subtitle>
-And you said, "Did he?"-Right, but---</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:12"><subtitle>
And I said, "Yes, he did."And you said, "Really?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:15"><subtitle>
-I'm not sure about that."-Yeah--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:16"><subtitle>
And I said, "Well, I am."And you said, "I'm not so sure."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:20"><subtitle>
And I said, "I'm telling you,Tony Curtis is dead."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:22"><subtitle>
And you said,"Let's check the Internet."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:24"><subtitle>
And I said, "We don't need to checkthe Internet, I'm telling you he's dead."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:27"><subtitle>
And you said, "Let's just check though."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:30"><subtitle>
Is that what you think happened?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:33"><subtitle>
So, do you wanna talk about it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:34"><subtitle>
It kind of feelslike you wanna talk about it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:37"><subtitle>
I don't understand why you couldn'tjust believe that I know something.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:40"><subtitle>
I believe you know lots of things.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:42"><subtitle>
I just thought,what's the harm in checking?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:44"><subtitle>
Especially since we havethese amazing little boxes nowwith 24-hour access to the world'slargest source of information.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:51"><subtitle>
You shouldn't have to check if your wifeknows what she's talking about.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:54"><subtitle>
You humiliated mein front of all my friends.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:56"><subtitle>
You can give it a rest. Show's over.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:58"><subtitle>
Okay, but don't I geta little bit of creditfor inviting all of your friendsto an awesome surprise party?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:05"><subtitle>
No, because why did you think I wouldwant an awesome surprise party?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:09"><subtitle>
Is it the awesome partyou object to or...?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:12"><subtitle>
You always just assumethat everyone wants whatever you want.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:15"><subtitle>
Well, you knowwhat they say about assuming.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:17"><subtitle>
Makes an ass out of you and "ming."</subtitle>

Throwing you a partylike some sort of terrorist.</subtitle>

It's a well-known factthat if you really hate someone,really wanna hit them where it hurts,throw them a party.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:37"><subtitle>
That's why when we go to war,we don't drop bombs on the enemy.</subtitle>
