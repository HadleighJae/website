</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:10"><subtitle>
I don't wanna do my homework!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:12"><subtitle>
What, what, what?</subtitle>
</timestamp>

Over at Chicken 4 Dayz,they pump their chickensfull of hormonesand keep them cooped upin tiny cages.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:40"><subtitle>
Now, as a chicken, this concerns me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:43"><subtitle>
Here at Gentle Farms,we treat our livestock differently.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:46"><subtitle>
Lush fields, plenty of dignity,and foosball. <description>chuckles</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:51"><subtitle>
The chickens herehave wonderful livesbefore we harvest them,so you can eat them.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:56"><subtitle>
But wait, Pa, aren't we chickens?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:58"><subtitle>
I don't wanna get eaten!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:00"><subtitle>
Boy, these animals aren't like us.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:02"><subtitle>
They're specifically bred to be eaten,and genetically modifiedfor maximum flavor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:08"><subtitle>
When our chicks first hatch,we lovingly inject them</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:11"><subtitle>
with natural delicious hormones,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:14"><subtitle>
which makes them meat,thereby erasing any moral gray area!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:18"><subtitle>
Now you can feel goodabout eating our meat.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:20"><subtitle>
It's simple:No one knows chicken like chickens.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:58"><subtitle>
How do I put this delicately? No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:00"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:04:11"><subtitle>
BoJack, the only reasonyou want Kelsey to like youis because she's cold and distant.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:19"><subtitle>
We can take my car.This is perfect.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:21"><subtitle>
Why is this perfect?My daughter could be in danger.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:23"><subtitle>
Yes, I agree, but we can use the car rideto get some one-on-one.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

Okay, fine. Let's go.</subtitle>

I don't understandwhy you need me to like you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:10"><subtitle>
I don't need you to like me.It would be fun if you liked me,because I'd prove my parents were wrongto never support me,because I earned the admirationof an authority figure,proving I have intrinsic worth,but it's not a big deal or anything.Jeez.</subtitle>
