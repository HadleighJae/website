</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:21"><subtitle>
"Zero, zero, zero" is "call me,"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:23"><subtitle>
and "1-2-3" is "I miss you"and "8-0-0-8-5" is boobs.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

What? Boobs? Oh, my God.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:27"><subtitle>
My heel brokewhile I was at this new food truck,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:30"><subtitle>
and I spilled a handful of gravyall over myself</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:32"><subtitle>
because they don't sell bowls,just gravy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:35"><subtitle>
Should've gone to the bowl truck first.That's where they get you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:38"><subtitle>
Well, I guess the upside to beinginvisible around here</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:41"><subtitle>
is that none of these assholeswill ever notice what a mess I am.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:44"><subtitle>
Well, if it makes you feel any better,I see what a mess you are.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:47"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description> Aw...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:48"><subtitle>
Do you need the movie-star speech?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:50"><subtitle>
No, no, I'll be okay.And how are you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:54"><subtitle>
Gotta look at paint for the new kitchen.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:56"><subtitle>
I have to pick a shade that won't clashwith the splatter of bloodfrom when I blow my brains outafter talking to Katieabout paint swatches all day. <description>laughs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:04"><subtitle>
We do have fun.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:10"><subtitle>
So, what's the plan for today?Find a new agent, go on auditions?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:13"><subtitle>
No, I'm gonna do exactly what landed meMr. Peanutbutter's House, oh, so long ago.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:18"><subtitle>
Wander around L.A. with an open mindand an empty stomachuntil I get discovered.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:22"><subtitle>
But also, like, find a new agentand go on auditions, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:25"><subtitle>
Or should I start stealing foodfrom work?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:27"><subtitle>
I'm just gonna go with the flowand leave everything up to destiny.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:31"><subtitle>
-Que sera quesadilla.-You know we could lose the house, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:34"><subtitle>
-<description>laughs</description> Diane.-Right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:36"><subtitle>
Diane, Diane, Diane.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:38"><subtitle>
<description>door opens then closes</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:48"><subtitle>
-Diane.-Aah!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:49"><subtitle>
I wasn't stealing paper towelsto use as dinner napkins. Why?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:52"><subtitle>
Here's a funny question for you:</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:54"><subtitle>
If Mr. Peanutbutter said,"I love you. No, I don't,"would you need to talk about that laterand figure out what he meant?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:00"><subtitle>
Probably not, right?Because they're meaningless words?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:03"><subtitle>
I mean, language evolves, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:04"><subtitle>
How can anyone knowwhat anything means?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:06"><subtitle>
The answer is nobody can.Nothing means anything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:08"><subtitle>
So why bother talking about anything?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:10"><subtitle>
In this scenario, are Mr. Peanutbutterand I living in our house?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:13"><subtitle>
Or are we squatting in an abandonedBarnes &amp; Noble burning books to keep warmas we struggle throughour Dickensian-style poverty?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:20"><subtitle>
Uh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:20"><subtitle>
<description>beeper plays ringtone</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:22"><subtitle>
"Zero, zero, zero."No idea what that means.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:24"><subtitle>
I think it means "call me."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:26"><subtitle>
Ignore. Wait, where's the ignore button?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:28"><subtitle>
How do I ignore?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:30"><subtitle>
I think with a beeper, you just ignore it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:32"><subtitle>
-With what, my mind?-You seem a little stressed out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:35"><subtitle>
That's becauseas soon as I'm done with work,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:37"><subtitle>
I have to have a long,awkward conversationwith Wanda about our relationship,unless... I'm never done with work.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:44"><subtitle>
Diane, you magnificent bastard. That's it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:53"><subtitle>
I'll be out there in the stands.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:55"><subtitle>
And I'll be rooting for you, Secretariat.</subtitle>

Yeah, I know. I'm acting.Great. Now I gotta start all over.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:26"><subtitle>
-Ronnie Bonito. Because he's dead.-He is?</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:11:06"><subtitle>
Can't believe you haveso many names for it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:08"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:14"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:11:19"><subtitle>
-So, like a normal rainbow?-But it's too dangerous, man.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:29"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:31"><subtitle>
When I see someone,and I think they can dance,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:34"><subtitle>
I say,"Hey, I think you can dance."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:37"><subtitle>
And when I think they can't dance,I say, "No, I don't think you can dance."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:41"><subtitle>
-And that is pretty much it.-Fascinating.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:14:05"><subtitle>
-Isn't he dead?-He's "reclusive."</subtitle>

Dude wanted to be left alone so much,he faked his own death.</subtitle>

Wait. So, you're sayingif someone loves you,they don't want you to choke yourselfwhile masturbating?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:55"><subtitle>
Yeah. It's really dangerous.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:57"><subtitle>
-All right. I'll take it.-Thanks, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:00"><subtitle>
I still don't understandwhy you need a kit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:02"><subtitle>
Can't you just use,like, a belt or a rope?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:04"><subtitle>
Oh, I guess.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:06"><subtitle>
I mean, I guess you could use anything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:08"><subtitle>
I mean, you could use an iPhone charger,a shoelace, a necktie, a jump-rope...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:18"><subtitle>
<description>Carolyn</description> Hm...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:22"><subtitle>
Oh. Ooh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:25"><subtitle>
-Oh, hello. I'm looking for some---Sorry, no looking allowed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:28"><subtitle>
This store is for customers only.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:30"><subtitle>
Okay, then, I would like to buy a bicycle.What would you recommend?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:34"><subtitle>
-One with a bell, or--?-You got me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:36"><subtitle>
I don't know anything about bicycles.I'm J.D. Salinger. I faked my own death.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:40"><subtitle>
Mr. Salinger. Such a pleasure.Princess Carolyn, big fan.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:45"><subtitle>
Let me guess, Catcher in the Rye?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:47"><subtitle>
And others.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:49"><subtitle>
-I wanna say The Hobbi---Nope.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:51"><subtitle>
Look. I'm an agent.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:53"><subtitle>
It doesn't matterwhether I've read your work.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:55"><subtitle>
What matters is I can look youin the eye and tell you I'm a big fan.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:59"><subtitle>
The world is ready for your comeback,and I wanna help.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:02"><subtitle>
No, thank you. Not interested.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:04"><subtitle>
Did that before, didn't work out well.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:06"><subtitle>
Fans were relentless.The critics were cruel.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:08"><subtitle>
And that's why my motto is,"It's better to be alone."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:11"><subtitle>
Which, come to think of it,is probably why I don't sella lot of tandem bicycles.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:16"><subtitle>
But, J.D. Salinger,you are J.D. Salinger.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:18"><subtitle>
You are a goddamn American treasure.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:21"><subtitle>
But every time I go out in the world,people hound me about my books.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:24"><subtitle>
Well, book.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:26"><subtitle>
What if I told you there was a placewhere no one reads books?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:29"><subtitle>
I'm listening.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:30"><subtitle>
A place where people only readheadlines, lists and pictures.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:33"><subtitle>
A place where peoplehate reading so much,they hire others to do it for themand don't even pay a living wage.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:39"><subtitle>
What do you mean,like, modern reading slaves?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:42"><subtitle>
Exactly.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:44"><subtitle>
And all those modern reading slavesreally wanna be doingis writing things that, one day,other people will also avoid reading.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:50"><subtitle>
-Does such a place truly exist?-Come with me, J.D. Salinger.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:20"><subtitle>
-What? Funky Spider-Man?-I came up with that one myself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:22"><subtitle>
Because he hangs,then he shoots webbing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:24"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:28"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:31"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:36"><subtitle>
-Okay. I get it.-Since you don't, I should do it, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:39"><subtitle>
I mean, there's no reason not to...unless you love me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:42"><subtitle>
-Do it.-Wait. Seriously?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:44"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:48"><subtitle>
<description>laughs</description> Only if I do it wrong.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:51"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:53"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:19:28"><subtitle>
J.D. Salinger has inspiredcountless dreamers,eighth gradersand occasionally, assassins.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

J.D. Take it away.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:12"><subtitle>
It's maybe more of a working title.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:14"><subtitle>
I can see it on the marquee already.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:16"><subtitle>
-Must be a long marquee.-It's long.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:53"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:56"><subtitle>
You know, it just goes to show,with the right attitude,every single one of your dreamswill always come true.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:02"><subtitle>
And if your dreams don't come true,it's probably because you justdidn't have the right attitude.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:10"><subtitle>
Today, one agent did somethingthat no one else could.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:15"><subtitle>
I'll give you two hints: catcher and rye.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:18"><subtitle>
Oh. Nothing. It's nothing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:20"><subtitle>
Charley Witherspoon caught a rye bagelcoming out of the toaster.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:24"><subtitle>
-Come again?-It was coming fast and hot.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:27"><subtitle>
One day, some genius will inventsome sort of bagel catcherthat takes the guesswork out of this task,but until then, Charley gets a gold star.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:36"><subtitle>
-Thanks, Dad. I mean, Mr. Dad.-Oh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:45"><subtitle>
Oh, boy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:46"><subtitle>
Hey. Wasn't sure if I'd see you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:48"><subtitle>
Still alive? Because auto-eroticasphyxiation is so risky?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:51"><subtitle>
Well, here I am, for now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:53"><subtitle>
BoJack... Wait.Did you fix the bed?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:56"><subtitle>
Yeah. I was at the hardware storepicking up supplies for my auto-eroticasphyxiation machine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:01"><subtitle>
Because, as you are aware,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:02"><subtitle>
I'm preparing to auto-eroticasphyxiate myself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:05"><subtitle>
Figured I'd get stuff for the bed so youcould at least get a good night's sleep.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:09"><subtitle>
Okay, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:11"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:23:54"><subtitle>
Okay.Carolyn, you are the star of a movie.</subtitle>

This is the part of the moviewhere you get your heart broken.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:03"><subtitle>
