</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:41"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:45"><subtitle>
Now we open the floor to questionsfrom the audience.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:49"><subtitle>
BoJack, your book talked a lot abouthow much you love apple fritters.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:53"><subtitle>
Yeah, thanks for that, Diane.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:55"><subtitle>
So, my question is:</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:56"><subtitle>
Do you think Israelhas a right to defend herself?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:59"><subtitle>
-Uh...-And what part should the U.S. playas an ally?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:02"><subtitle>
<description>groans</description></subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:07:03"><subtitle>
Well, the thing about that...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:05"><subtitle>
<description>both growl</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:07"><subtitle>
Uh... It's a shame that Arafatwalked away from the table in 2000.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:11"><subtitle>
I mean, obviously there's no panacea,but a two-state solution</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:14"><subtitle>
with an emphasis on human rightsfeels like a place to begin.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:16"><subtitle>
<description>audience murmuring</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:17"><subtitle>
-<description>Moose</description> Brilliant insight.-<description>woman</description> Very good.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:20"><subtitle>
-My question is for Diane Nyu-- Nyu---Oh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:22"><subtitle>
- Nyu---You won't get it. Ask the question.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:25"><subtitle>
Your book went to some revealing places.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:26"><subtitle>
Were you worried at all that itwould hurt BoJack or his career?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:29"><subtitle>
That's a great question.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:31"><subtitle>
I'd also like to knowthe answer to that, Diane.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:33"><subtitle>
Well, I think the truthis worth pursuing, no matter what.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:37"><subtitle>
BoJack's not perfect.There are other celebritieswho have done much worse thingsand it hasn't hurt their careers.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:43"><subtitle>
-Like who?-I don't know, like Mike Tysonor... Sean Penn, or Josh Brolin,or Christian Slater, Woody Allen,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:50"><subtitle>
Hank Hippopopalous, Bill Murray...</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:01"><subtitle>
Any questions about me,the handsome, famous horse with a book?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:04"><subtitle>
What do you have against Uncle Hanky?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:06"><subtitle>
I'm not saying anythingnot on the public record.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:08"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:11:41"><subtitle>
I came with her. I gotta sayI'm opposed to child labor,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:44"><subtitle>
like as a rule, but thereare some kinds of labor</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:46"><subtitle>
that children are just better at.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:48"><subtitle>
You ever try to fitinto a mine shaft?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:50"><subtitle>
That is a tight squeeze. What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:53"><subtitle>
Oh, man, probably gonna getsome letters about that, huh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:55"><subtitle>
I'm so incorrigible.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:11:57"><subtitle>
Everyone's paying attentionto me now!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:59"><subtitle>
Okay, I'm gonna go get a snack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:01"><subtitle>
Anyone else want a snack?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:03"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:07"><subtitle>
What do you have againstHank Hippopopalous?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:09"><subtitle>
Everyone sayshe's a really nice guy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:11"><subtitle>
Good point.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:12"><subtitle>
That's exactly the problem.Because he's so nice,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:14"><subtitle>
people don't wanna thinkhe's capable of awful things</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:17"><subtitle>
so they let him off the hook.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:18"><subtitle>
We don't know what happened.It's a classic "he said, she said."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:21"><subtitle>
"He said, they said."It's eight different women.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:25"><subtitle>
-Are they all lying?-I mean, probably. We do that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:28"><subtitle>
At this point,we just don't know enough to judge.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:31"><subtitle>
Who are these women?Have they ever shoplifted perhaps?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:33"><subtitle>
Do they wear short shorts?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:34"><subtitle>
Do they drink alcohol?All these things are possible.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:37"><subtitle>
We don't know the facts.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:38"><subtitle>
See, this is part of the problem.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:40"><subtitle>
You're supposed to be a journalist.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:41"><subtitle>
You won't even tell your audiencewhat he's accused of.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:44"><subtitle>
You're an expert.Why don't you tell us?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:46"><subtitle>
I'm not afraid to say it.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:57"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:59"><subtitle>
Actually, this might bea thing she does.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:01"><subtitle>
She knows that Hippopopalousis the only thingkeeping my network afloat, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:05"><subtitle>
The same networkthat employs her husband.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:07"><subtitle>
Why would she do this?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:08"><subtitle>
Sometimes she just whipsherself into a frenzyand she loses all perspective.Goddamn it, honeydew?!</subtitle>
