</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:52"><subtitle>
I don't understandwhat started the fire.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:54"><subtitle>
Nobody knows where fires come from,it's a mystery.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:56"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:00"><subtitle>
We're gonna finishthat big Nixon scene.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:02"><subtitle>
We were just one shot awaybefore we went on hiatus.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:05"><subtitle>
Yeah, I know.You told me at breakfast.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:07"><subtitle>
Why did you call me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:08"><subtitle>
Usually I talk to Dianeon the way to work,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:10"><subtitle>
but she abandoned me to teach pianoin Cordovia or something.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:13"><subtitle>
Oh. Well, glad you settled for mebecause Diane wasn't available.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:16"><subtitle>
You bet. Oh, man, I'm gonna killin this Nixon scene.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:24"><subtitle>
What happened to da house set?Da White House set?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:27"><subtitle>
-Things changed a little.-You cut the Nixon scene?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:30"><subtitle>
The Nixon scene is the coreof the whole movie.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:32"><subtitle>
Where we see Secretariatbe morally corruptedand get to lookinto the real darkness of his soul.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:37"><subtitle>
It's still all that,except now it happenswhile you give a Christmas presentto your niecesand they hug youwhile your butt is stuck in a chimney.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:44"><subtitle>
Is one of the nieces Nixon?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:46"><subtitle>
Over hiatus, we ran a focus group.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:47"><subtitle>
People don't wantall that controversial stuff.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:50"><subtitle>
But we were supposed to makea gritty movie about the real Secretariat.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:53"><subtitle>
-Warts and all.-Kid, "warts and all" don't pay bubkes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:56"><subtitle>
That's why they took the gay stuffout of A Beautiful Mind.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:58"><subtitle>
Know that guy who spent 12 yearsas a slave?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:00"><subtitle>
They don't talk about the 60 yearshe spent as a jerk.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:03"><subtitle>
-Kelsey, you're okay with this?-Eh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:05"><subtitle>
That's showbiz.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:06"><subtitle>
See, BoJack,that's the shrug of a pro who gets it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:09"><subtitle>
Good shrugging, kid.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:12"><subtitle>
Yo! Care-to-the-O-to-the-Lyn-to-the...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:15"><subtitle>
That's the end of your name.We need to talk.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:17"><subtitle>
We'll meet in the supply closetin one minute. Break!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:19"><subtitle>
Oh, okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:21"><subtitle>
Ooh, ow.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:22"><subtitle>
Carolyn, when you're in the throesof a very ugly divorce such as I am,along with all that pain and degradationcomes a certain perfect clarity,and right now that clarity is telling methat you and I should get out of here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:36"><subtitle>
Well, what do you mean,"get out of here"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:38"><subtitle>
Beautiful, I'm starting my own agency,and I want you to be my partner in crime.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:43"><subtitle>
What? But I can't just leave Vigor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:45"><subtitle>
I've been here 20 years.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:46"><subtitle>
Who's gonna water the plants?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:48"><subtitle>
Um, I'm sorry. You water the plants?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:50"><subtitle>
I started doing it as an intern,but then no one told me to stop,so it's still kind of my job.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:54"><subtitle>
Carolyn,you are my gritty, witty city kitty.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:57"><subtitle>
I want you with me, fifty-fifty.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:59"><subtitle>
Things are so crazyfor me right now. I--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:01"><subtitle>
Don't give me that, you want crazy."Crazy" is your favorite Patsy Cline songand your second favoriteGnarls Barkley song.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:07"><subtitle>
I don't want crazy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:08"><subtitle>
I've got five episodesof The Good Wife piled up on my DVR,and I just want a night offto enjoy them.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:14"><subtitle>
Well, if that's how you feel, I guessI could just go to Vanessa Gekko.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:18"><subtitle>
-<description>Carolyn</description> Gekko?!-But I'd rather look at you all day.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:22"><subtitle>
You're an amazing agent.And you're bright, and you're fun.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:26"><subtitle>
And I think we could make somethingreally special.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:29"><subtitle>
We weren't doing anything!We were just looking for closet supplies.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:33"><subtitle>
Are you the person to talk toabout unclogging the toilet?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:36"><subtitle>
Stuart, I'm your boss.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:38"><subtitle>
Okay, but you're the onein the janitor's closet, so...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:41"><subtitle>
-What, I'm the idiot?-<description>sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:47"><subtitle>
<description>Diane</description> The first thing you noticeabout Sebastian St. Clair</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:50"><subtitle>
is that he speaks in paragraphs.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:51"><subtitle>
Even I can't believehow much good we've done here,and I'll believe almost anything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:55"><subtitle>
In the last six weeks,we dug a new well, built a school,and next monththe community center is doing Seussical.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:01"><subtitle>
There we go.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:02"><subtitle>
<description>Diane</description> In his previous life,Sebastian owned</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:04"><subtitle>
a chain of high-end department stores.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:06"><subtitle>
I want to stock up on muffs.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:08"><subtitle>
We're going to sell a lot of muffsthis winter. Huzzah!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:12"><subtitle>
Diane, I lived a lifeof power and luxury,and then my picturewas in the newspaper.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:17"><subtitle>
-A real-life newspaper!-Uh-huh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:18"><subtitle>
But I knew my life was empty.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:20"><subtitle>
At night I heard the criesof children sick and dying.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:23"><subtitle>
And I would scream into the night.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:25"><subtitle>
Shut up! Shut up, children!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:28"><subtitle>
But the phantom cries would not abate.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:31"><subtitle>
And so I began my travels,with little more than a compass,a yearning for adventure,and several crates full of unsold muffs.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:37"><subtitle>
I knew there were people out therejust waiting for my help.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:40"><subtitle>
Diane, this is Kinko.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:42"><subtitle>
I am Kinko.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:43"><subtitle>
In his language, it means,orphan whose parents were murderedby rebels and will die young,probably from malaria.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:49"><subtitle>
Hi, Kinko. I'm Diane.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:51"><subtitle>
It means,my parents liked the show Cheers.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:53"><subtitle>
Cheers! Oh, you're good.You're very good.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:58"><subtitle>
<description>Diane</description> When Sebastian St. Clair saysyou're good,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:00"><subtitle>
you want to believethat you really are.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:02"><subtitle>
That you, like Sebastian, are partof something bigger than just yourself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:05"><subtitle>
And for a moment,you feel like you are.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:09"><subtitle>
<description>Sebastian</description> Oh, Kinko made a mess.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:12"><subtitle>
Now I finally realize that a triple hug isway more valuable than a Triple Crown.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:17"><subtitle>
And cut. Neat.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:19"><subtitle>
-Let's break for lunch.-<description>kids</description> Oh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:23"><subtitle>
Kelsey, this is a nightmare.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:25"><subtitle>
I had to touch three children today,and one of them was sticky.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:28"><subtitle>
Yeah, it was you.Wash your damn hands, you gremlin.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:30"><subtitle>
-BoJack, there's nothing we can do.-No, this isn't you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:33"><subtitle>
I've seen everything you've done.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:35"><subtitle>
Your films are challenging and gritty,and they're great.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:37"><subtitle>
I'm not just saying thatbecause they're full of lesbians.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:40"><subtitle>
Look, even if I wanted to finishthat Nixon scene,we don't have an Oval Office set.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:44"><subtitle>
There's one at the Nixon Libraryin Yorba Linda.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:46"><subtitle>
Why on earth do you know that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:48"><subtitle>
In season three of Horsin' Around,the horse got elected presidentand we shot on location.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:52"><subtitle>
We can sneak into the libraryand get the shot, guerilla-style.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:55"><subtitle>
Once Turteltaub sees it,he'll love it,and we can make the moviewe both want to make.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:59"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:00"><subtitle>
-Okay, I'm in. Let's do it.-All right!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:03"><subtitle>
Did they really makeyour character president?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:06"><subtitle>
Only for season three.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:07"><subtitle>
In season four, it turned outit was all a dream.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:09"><subtitle>
They called my airplane Air Horse One.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:12"><subtitle>
And the vice president wasa hip-hop zebra named Zebro.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:14"><subtitle>
-Come on.-It wasn't our best season.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:16"><subtitle>
But on the bright side,was not our worst.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:19"><subtitle>
Step one, we go to the Nixon Library...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:22"><subtitle>
and steal the scale model.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:25"><subtitle>
<description>man as Nixon</description> Welcome to my library.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:27"><subtitle>
I'm Nixon. <description>chuckles</description>.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:30"><subtitle>
<description>in normal voice</description> Yeah, you know,some people say I look like Nixon.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:33"><subtitle>
Not because he's my dad or anything.That's crazy. Nixon's not my dad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:36"><subtitle>
But if you have any questions about Nixon,I'd be happy to answer them.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:40"><subtitle>
Yeah, I have a question. Um...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:43"><subtitle>
Is that the lighted exit signfrom Nixon's boyhood home?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:46"><subtitle>
Uh, no, that's just an exit sign.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:49"><subtitle>
-Is that...-Here we go.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:50"><subtitle>
...the handicapped drinking fountainhe used in the White House?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:54"><subtitle>
No, just a normal drinking fountain.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:55"><subtitle>
-Hang on.-One more.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:57"><subtitle>
-Is that the smoke alarm--?-No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:59"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles nervously</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:02"><subtitle>
So the Oval Office is right here,next to the men's room.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:05"><subtitle>
I remember because season threeof Horsin' Around was a big cocaine year.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:08"><subtitle>
All the pressures of being president.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:10"><subtitle>
-I don't see how we'll pull this off.-We're gonna need a crack team.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:13"><subtitle>
First, we gotta getthe best lock-pick in the city.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:16"><subtitle>
-Not interested.-Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:19"><subtitle>
The second best lock-pick in the city.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:21"><subtitle>
-No way I'm doing that.-Got it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:23"><subtitle>
A lock-pick.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:24"><subtitle>
Todd, can you pick locks?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:25"><subtitle>
-Kind of.-Great. You're in.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:27"><subtitle>
We'll need an expert cat burglar.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:29"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:31"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:18"><subtitle>
It's too bad though because I couldreally bring a lot to this project.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:21"><subtitle>
The more I think about it,Checkers wouldn't even be in the shot.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:25"><subtitle>
It's just a single on Secretariat.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:26"><subtitle>

Yeah? What, another leftist screedabout how corrupt he was?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:54"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:04"><subtitle>

You're just using them as propsfor your big-shot superhero act.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:19"><subtitle>
Diane, the dead will not benefitfrom our grief,but the survivors need a new hospitaland we need to build it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:26"><subtitle>
This is too much.</subtitle>
