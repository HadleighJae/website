</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:45"><subtitle>
Sure, but no one's gonna hire meafter this movie comes out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:48"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:07"><subtitle>
New York Magazine called herthe enfant terribleof the immersive theater world,and then later clarifiedthat that's a compliment.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:14"><subtitle>
It sounds like the kind of thingI should be doing now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:16"><subtitle>
-Something artistic and bold.-Rehearsals start in two weeks.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:20"><subtitle>
Are you ready to go to New Yorkfor six months?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:22"><subtitle>
New York's a great city to live infor six monthsand not a second longer and onlyif you're insanely wealthy. I can't wait!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:31"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:35"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:38"><subtitle>
Which one of you guyswrote all those funny jokes?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:40"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:45"><subtitle>
-Let's try it. Give me a suggestion.-Uh... I don't know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:48"><subtitle>
Suggestions?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:49"><subtitle>
<description>all laughing</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:50"><subtitle>
Your suggestion was "suggestions."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:52"><subtitle>
-Way to break the fourth wall.-That wasn't that funny.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:55"><subtitle>
My name's Bryanand you haven't won me over yet.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:58"><subtitle>
-Oh, Bryan.-Todd, in improv,we get suggestions from an audiencethen make up scenes based on them.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:03"><subtitle>
There are just a few simple rules.You don't ask questions. You don't say no.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:07"><subtitle>
No matter what. When someone makes asuggestion, you always try to build on it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:11"><subtitle>
We call that "yes, and..."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:13"><subtitle>
Yes, and if you mess up, that's okay.It's all part of the fun.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:18"><subtitle>
Is it really that simple?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:19"><subtitle>
Ugh! It's incredibly complicatedand requires years of training.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:23"><subtitle>
Oh, Bryan.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:24"><subtitle>
<description>all laughing</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:26"><subtitle>
But improv isn't just about a constantclamoring for attention and validation.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:30"><subtitle>
It's about community.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:31"><subtitle>
I've always wanted to be partof a community.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:33"><subtitle>
Well, you are now.Your first class is $200.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:36"><subtitle>
I thought you said it was free.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:38"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:25"><subtitle>
What? No, improv is not a cult.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:28"><subtitle>
It's just a dogmatic school of thoughttaught by a for-profit organizationwith the promise of socialand professional opportunities.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:35"><subtitle>
-Ahh.-It's a cult. And I know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:37"><subtitle>

Improv is a cult.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:12:51"><subtitle>
I wanna be very clear.This is about improv.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:55"><subtitle>
-I really don't think it's that bad, guys.-Why does anything matter, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:59"><subtitle>
Love is an illusion,and happiness is fleeting,no such thing as God, and all yourfavorite musicians beat their wives.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:13:35"><subtitle>
-He's later than I am.-Bryan's not gonna be at practice anymore.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:38"><subtitle>
He's been negative, so Copernicus thoughthe could benefit from some time away.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:42"><subtitle>
He's been reassigned to the Shenanigagscomedy cruise line, the Giggleship.</subtitle>
