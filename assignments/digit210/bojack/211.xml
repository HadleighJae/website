Anyway, I know you're just in townfor the boat show,but seriously... make yourself at home.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:30"><subtitle>
I really don't want to impose.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:32"><subtitle>
If there's anything I can doto help around here--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:34"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:04:41"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:55"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:08"><subtitle>
Well, I guess I could make some time...before the boat show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:16"><subtitle>
Keep your eyes on the road,both hands on the wheel.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:19"><subtitle>
-Okay.-And don't text and drive,unless it's an emergency,like you have a really funny thingthat you just have to text someone.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:25"><subtitle>
-Got it.-So, let me ask you something. Tsk.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:28"><subtitle>
Do your parents really love each other,or is ita stay-together-for-the-kids situation?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:33"><subtitle>
What? Why would you ask me that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:35"><subtitle>
I don't know. Just making conversation.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:37"><subtitle>
-Why do we keep passing the same house?-No, I don't. Shut up.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:40"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:05:43"><subtitle>
College kid that gives you Adderall?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:44"><subtitle>
Okay, fine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:46"><subtitle>
That's Diego Mendoza's house.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:48"><subtitle>
He's just this stupid guy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:50"><subtitle>
He's in my calculus class,and sometimes we'll do this thingwhere he goes, "Hey,"and then I go, "Hey."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:55"><subtitle>
Then he goes, "What's the homework?"and I tell him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:58"><subtitle>
It's not like a big deal or anything,but it's like this thing we do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:01"><subtitle>
-Cool thing.-So, anyway...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:04"><subtitle>
My best friend, Alison F.was talking to Rachel Kaplan.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:06"><subtitle>
<description>BoJack</description> Do I really needto know these names?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:08"><subtitle>
<description>Penny</description> Rachel heard from Ray-Rayand the Bean</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:10"><subtitle>
that Diego saidif prom happened right now</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:12"><subtitle>
he'd want to go with Ali Sandler,and I'm like,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:14"><subtitle>
"Yeah, pfft, okay, dude."You know what I mean?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:17"><subtitle>
You know I don't knowany of these people, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:19"><subtitle>
But then he saidsince prom's not for another two months,he could "foresee a situation"where he would want to go with me,because he knows I'm a real girlwho's mostly chill. <description>chuckles</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:29"><subtitle>
If you're so mostly chill,why do you keep driving by his house?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:32"><subtitle>
In case he comes out,to, like, check the mail or something.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:35"><subtitle>
I'll get out of the car and be like,"That's so funny.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:37"><subtitle>
I was just going for a drive."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:39"><subtitle>
And he'll be like, "Oh, hey."And I'll be like, "Hey."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:42"><subtitle>
-'Cause that's our thing, you know? Heh.-That's the whole plan?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:45"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:59"><subtitle>
And I didn't know where else to go.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:02"><subtitle>
-Please do not tell your parents.-Well, I won't,but I think people are gonna noticeif you go to a boat showand don't come back with a boat.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:35"><subtitle>
-Maybe they'll put me in next game.-Sure, they will.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:38"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:08:04"><subtitle>
-The boat? It does not.-Come on. You gotta give her a name.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:08"><subtitle>
You should call her the Escape From L.A.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:10"><subtitle>
That actually is a good name for it,the nongendered object.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:13"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:07"><subtitle>
If I know me, it might leadto some pretty zany misadventures.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:12"><subtitle>
Mm. Brussels sprouts are delicious, Mom.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:13"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:28"><subtitle>
-Right, BoJack?-That's right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:29"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:10:35"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:37"><subtitle>
Oh, my God. I'm not in a mood.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:39"><subtitle>
Whatever. Get bent.</subtitle>

<description>door slams</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:44"><subtitle>
<description>BoJack and Charlotte</description> I'll talk to her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:46"><subtitle>
Everyone said for months</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:47"><subtitle>
-that Diego was gonna ask me to prom.-Yeah?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:49"><subtitle>
-But he keeps not doing it.-That is so typical Diego.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:52"><subtitle>
So, I thought, okay,if he's not going to ask me, I'll ask him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:55"><subtitle>
-Way to take initiative.-Oh. Rookie mistake.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:57"><subtitle>
So, I asked him and he said no.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:58"><subtitle>
And then this other girl, Lyla K.,came up to him and was just like, "Hey."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:02"><subtitle>
And he was like, "Hey."And that's our thing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:05"><subtitle>
Well, I don't want to tell talesout of school,but this Lyla K. charactersounds like a real bust-ass super-skank.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:11"><subtitle>
Thank you, that is exactly what she is.It's weird that nobody talks about it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:15"><subtitle>
Well, you know, sometimes it's niceto not have a date,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:18"><subtitle>
-because you can actually---Mom.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:19"><subtitle>
I can't go to the prom without a date.It's not like when you were in high school</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:23"><subtitle>
-and you'd go to your sock hops.-Do you think</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:26"><subtitle>
-I went to high school in the '50s?-Penny, hey, I got an idea.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:29"><subtitle>
-You should take me to the prom.-Huh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:30"><subtitle>
Everybody loves having BoJack around.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:32"><subtitle>
What? Why?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:34"><subtitle>
Think about it. If you went with Diego,you'd be nervous.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:36"><subtitle>
"Does he like me? Am I cool?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:38"><subtitle>
But with me you can just relaxand enjoy yourself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:41"><subtitle>
Diego will see youhave a good time without him,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:43"><subtitle>
and that'll make him super jealous.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:45"><subtitle>
So, he'll come up to you,and he'll say, "Hey."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:47"><subtitle>
And then you say, "Hey."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:49"><subtitle>
-Oh, that's so cold.-Right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:51"><subtitle>
-Wait---Rachel Kaplan's gonna shit herself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:54"><subtitle>
-How is that cold?-Then he'll say, "Wanna dance?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:56"><subtitle>
And you'll say,"I'm busy right now. Maybe later."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:58"><subtitle>
And then... never dance with him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:01"><subtitle>
-That'll show him.-Wait-- I'm sorry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:04"><subtitle>
-Don't you want to dance with Diego?-Stop poking holes, Charlotte.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:06"><subtitle>
-This is a great plan.-Yeah, Mom, don't poke holes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:09"><subtitle>

<description>Pete</description> Guys?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:17"><subtitle>
I think you should come down here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:19"><subtitle>
She's still breathing,but she won't wake up.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:36"><subtitle>

</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:58"><subtitle>
You don't want too many people aroundin a hospital setting.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:01"><subtitle>
If anyone asks,tell them we left the dance early,and you don't knowwhere Maddy got the whiskey.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:06"><subtitle>
Why?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:07"><subtitle>
It's one thing if a bunch of kidsget drunk on prom night,but if there's an adult there,I was supposed to be responsible,and then the whole thing feelskind of creepy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:15"><subtitle>
Are you sure she's gonna be okay?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:16"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:21"><subtitle>
Penny and I left early.You don't know who gave Maddy whiskey.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

Just listen to him.He knows what he's doing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:30"><subtitle>
It's gonna be okay.Where did Maddy get the alcohol from?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:32"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:33"><subtitle>

It's a part of growing up.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:04"><subtitle>
And we did the right thing back there,you think?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:07"><subtitle>
I... <description>sighs</description>Look, sometimes when you're an adult,the right thingisn't always the best thing.</subtitle>
