<timestamp time="00:04:23"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:35"><subtitle>
My point is,I don't understand how people live.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:39"><subtitle>
It's amazing to me that peoplewake up every morning</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:04:42"><subtitle>

</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:05"><subtitle>
Copernicus, how do you always comeup with these amazing butt jokes?</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:05:09"><subtitle>
When you're a Level Nine, as I am,you don't come up with butt jokes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:14"><subtitle>
You live truthfully in the momentand the butt joke comes to you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:18"><subtitle>
So true. So wise.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:20"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:35"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:50"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:57"><subtitle>
Please don't call us nerds, sir.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

Something happened to you,so these nerds finished the movie.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:19"><subtitle>
Not technically, but computer youis giving the performance of your career.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:23"><subtitle>
When people see what you do in this movie,they are gonna stormDaniel Day-Lewis's house,schlep him out into the street,shoot him in the head.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:30"><subtitle>
That's how good your performance is.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:32"><subtitle>
It's gonna make Daniel Day-Lewislook like shit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:34"><subtitle>

If we hire someone to micromanageour clients' online personasand new media outreach, they'll seemmore grounded down to earth.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:07"><subtitle>
Smiling poop emoji,I love everything about that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:10"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:07:34"><subtitle>
-This is the wife you're divorcing, right?-You know how it is.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:37"><subtitle>
You say you want a divorceand she says, "No, we can make this work."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:40"><subtitle>
You go to counseling andremember why you fell in love with herin the first placeand then, blah, blah, it's a whole thing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

We've been sleeping togetherfor three months.</subtitle>

-We're about to start a company together.-None of that has to change.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:51"><subtitle>
I am definitely going to divorceher probably, it's just...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:55"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:39"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:08:44"><subtitle>
I don't know why everyone keeps askingif I remember things. I don't.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:47"><subtitle>
Just as a general rule,if your question begins, "Do you remember"and doesn't end with "how much you hatedMoulin Rouge," the answer's no.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:54"><subtitle>
I was so happy to have a placeto stay that I made pancakes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:58"><subtitle>
And you kept eating themso I kept making them.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:00"><subtitle>
And then you got mad at mefor letting you eat so many pancakes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:04"><subtitle>
You tried to chase me around the pool,but you were too hungoverand also full from the pancakesso instead... you took a nap.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:12"><subtitle>
And when you woke up, you said,"Thanks for the pancakes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:17"><subtitle>
-Now get out of my house."-I don't remember any of that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:20"><subtitle>
Well, anyway, I'm finally moving out,just like you wanted.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:25"><subtitle>
Good. Honestly, you'll probablybe better off without me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:28"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:30"><subtitle>
Yeah. But we had some good times,though, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:33"><subtitle>
-Did we?-Right. Well, um, take care.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:57"><subtitle>
I want you to come onboardand write celebrity tweets.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:01"><subtitle>
-I don't know how to do that.-You're a ghost-writer.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:03"><subtitle>
It's the same as writing a book,they're just a lot shorterand more people read them.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:08"><subtitle>
All right, but why are you helping me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:11"><subtitle>
Because my life is a mess right now and Icompulsively take care of other peoplewhen I don't know howto take care of myself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:16"><subtitle>
Oh. I was hoping it wasbecause you believed in me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:20"><subtitle>
I don't.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:25"><subtitle>
Welcome to my Giggleship.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:26"><subtitle>
For us, it's a place to realizeour higher selves. For the paying public,it's a place to watch improv and drinkwatered-down margaritas for 8.99.</subtitle>

Wow, we must all make a lot of money.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:37"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:55"><subtitle>
And you can use improv to makethis room anything you want it to be.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:59"><subtitle>
My cabin is exactly like yours,but when I use my imagination,it becomes a rich stateroomwith a treasure chest full of booty.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:06"><subtitle>
I like a big booty, if you know whatI mean. And I don't mean a butt.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:10"><subtitle>
<description>laughing</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>

You're 24, you live on my couch andyou've always seen the good in me somehow.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:54"><subtitle>
You've been brainwashed into thinkingthat you belong here, but you don't.You belong back home.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:58"><subtitle>
If you're any kind of improviser,you'll take that suggestionand you'll run with it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:02"><subtitle>
Huh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:05"><subtitle>
Let's get out of here.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:14"><subtitle>

Sorry, improv is funand great and everything,but you guys are really into improv.I'm gonna go with my friend.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:40"><subtitle>
Your friend?I didn't realize this man was your friend.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:43"><subtitle>
Well, then, by all means,go with him, Todd.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:46"><subtitle>
But, see, I thought this was the manwho sabotaged your rock opera.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:51"><subtitle>
The one who constantly abuses you andmakes you shower with a hose in the yard.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:55"><subtitle>
I invited him to.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:57"><subtitle>
The one who's never said a kind wordto you the entire time you've known him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:00"><subtitle>
-Is this your friend, Todd?-It's more complicated than that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:06"><subtitle>
-Is it? We're your friends, Todd.-More than that, we're a family.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:10"><subtitle>
-I, uh...-Hash browns.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:15"><subtitle>
-What?-I heard hash browns.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:16"><subtitle>
-Martha, did you see my hash browns?-Oh, my God, do you ever turn it off?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:20"><subtitle>
It was hash browns, not pancakes.The first morning you stayed with me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:24"><subtitle>
You kept making them and I kept eatingthem and then I threw up in the pool.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:28"><subtitle>
That made you throw up in the pool. Then Igot mad at you for throwing up in my pool.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:32"><subtitle>
-But, you said, "I'll clean it up."-And did I clean it up?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:35"><subtitle>
No. You didn't.I had to call the pool cleaner.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:38"><subtitle>
-Ha, ha.-And you said,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:40"><subtitle>
"Thank you for letting me stay here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:41"><subtitle>
I don't have anywhere else to go."And I remember when you said that,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:45"><subtitle>
"I don't have anywhere else to go,"because I felt good about myself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:49"><subtitle>
And I don't feel that way a lot.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:52"><subtitle>
Letting you stay with mewas the best thing I ever did on purpose.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:55"><subtitle>
I don't think I ever told you that.But I should have.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:58"><subtitle>
Because you're my best friend, Todd.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:02"><subtitle>
I'm not gonna lie, if you just made allthat up, that was some really good improv.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:06"><subtitle>
Game recognize game.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:11"><subtitle>
-Why do you have a boat?-Uh, I don't remember.</subtitle>

<description>distorted ringtone playing on phone</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:17"><subtitle>
-Hello? Prince?-Listen, bozo, I keep getting callsfrom this New York playwright,she really wants to talk to you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:24"><subtitle>
-She says you know her, Jill Pill?-Jill Pill?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:27"><subtitle>
Ring any bells?Apparently, she worked on your TV show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:30"><subtitle>
-Horsin' Around?-No, actually. The other TV show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:33"><subtitle>
Other TV show? Oh, shit. Jill.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:36"><subtitle>
I'm moving into the new officeand I got Herb's ashes here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:39"><subtitle>
I really don't know whatto do with this thing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:42"><subtitle>
-Do you want it?-Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:44"><subtitle>
<description>smashing noise over phone</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:45"><subtitle>
Why did I take you with me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:50"><subtitle>
Herb loved orphans.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:52"><subtitle>
Mostly as a delivery apparatusfor hackneyed punchlinesand mawkish sentimentality, but still.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:57"><subtitle>
And we will do our partto honor his legacy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:00"><subtitle>
-Hey, who's Jerb?-What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:01"><subtitle>
Jerb Ka-- Why does it say "Jerb Kazzaz?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:04"><subtitle>
Your e-mail said "Jerb."I forwarded it to the plaque guy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:08"><subtitle>
-Is it not--?-No, obviously that was a typo.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:10"><subtitle>
Why would I want to dedicate the orphanageto the memory of Jerb Kazzaz?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:14"><subtitle>
Kind of sounds like something you'd getat a Mediterranean restaurant,but wouldn't finish.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:19"><subtitle>
And the waiter would say, "You want meto box up this jerb kazzaz for you?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:22"><subtitle>
-And you'd say, "No."-You gotta fix this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:25"><subtitle>
Really? We spent a lot of moneyon this plaque, you know?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:28"><subtitle>
-And on the t-shirts.-Jerb's kids?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:31"><subtitle>
No, there's no Jerb. It's Herb.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:33"><subtitle>
T-shirt's say Jerbso I'm going by the t-shirts.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:37"><subtitle>
<description>groans</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:38"><subtitle>
You know, Herb would probably thinkthat this is pretty funny</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:42"><subtitle>
-that you couldn't even get this right.-Yeah. He would.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:47"><subtitle>
-So, in a way...-Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
