Horsin' Around was not a sucky show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:40"><subtitle>
- Yeah, but it was.- It lasted nine seasons.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:43"><subtitle>
Its whole purposewas for people to watch itso the network could sell ad time,so the show could make more moneythan it cost to produce.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:49"><subtitle>
It did that well. It was a good show.</subtitle>

But before you fold the omelette,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:45"><subtitle>
I'd like the chef to hold the pan upand whisper his or her dreams into it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:49"><subtitle>
Whisper dreams into omelette.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:53"><subtitle>
Just coffee.Don't need to talk to it at all. Thanks.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:55"><subtitle>
You look different. Older. A lot older.</subtitle>

You haven't heard from Cuddlywhiskersrecently, have you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:04"><subtitle>
Cuddlywhiskers? I haven't talkedto him since the show was canceled.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:07"><subtitle>
I worry about him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:08"><subtitle>
About six months back, he disappeared,stopped returning my calls.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:12"><subtitle>
I'm sure he's fine.I mean, who returns calls?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:16"><subtitle>
Promise me you'll check on himwhen you get back to L.A.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:19"><subtitle>
Maybe swing by his house?I think you owe him that much.</subtitle>

The Tragedy of Greg KingLear,a theatrical immersion by Jill Pill?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:26"><subtitle>
- Right.- That's dead. Over.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:28"><subtitle>
A thing that happenedthat happens no longer,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:30"><subtitle>
- like a whimper in the wind.- Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:31"><subtitle>
Theater is by its very nature ephemeral.We shout into the void, "Hey, you!"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:36"><subtitle>
And the void says,"Stop shouting at me, please!"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:39"><subtitle>
And we grab the void and we spitin its face, "Sir, I will not."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:43"><subtitle>
Boy, did New York do a number on you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:45"><subtitle>
Let me tell you about my next piece.It starts with you,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:48"><subtitle>
BoJack Horseman,completely naked and covered in milk.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:52"><subtitle>
- I'll stop you there.- It's a symbol for rebirth.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:54"><subtitle>
I'm not interested in being rebirthed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:56"><subtitle>
I'm still recoveringfrom being birthed the first time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:58"><subtitle>
Jill, I'm not the guy who does thingsthat are challenging,or edgy, or covered in milk.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:03"><subtitle>
I'm about to be nominated for an Oscar.I'm thinking about my legacy now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:06"><subtitle>
I want to do things that connectwith people, things that last.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:10"><subtitle>
That's the whole point, nothing lasts.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:12"><subtitle>
No, I know, but see, years after I die,people will still be ableto see me in Secretariat.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:16"><subtitle>
- And then what?- And then...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:19"><subtitle>
I'll be remembered.If I win an Oscar, I'll be remembered.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:22"><subtitle>
- And then what?- Then my life will have meaning.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:25"><subtitle>
- I don't know!- Mm-hmm.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:27"><subtitle>
You know what the real tragedyof Greg KingLear is?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:29"><subtitle>
Two hours long without an intermission?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:31"><subtitle>
It's that he's a marionette.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:32"><subtitle>
And he doesn't even know someone elseis pulling his strings.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:36"><subtitle>
Mmm, I don't think the chefwhispered his dreams into this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:39"><subtitle>
This does not taste like dreams.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:43"><subtitle>
You told me I would be gettingmore attention at a smaller agency,but if anything, I'm getting less.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:48"><subtitle>
Is this the best time to be on your phone?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:51"><subtitle>
I'm sorry.Let me just send this one email...</subtitle>

J.D. Salinger is too big a star to behamstrung by some rinky-dink operationworking out of a two-story warehouse.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:06"><subtitle>
I need an agencywith at least nine stories.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:08"><subtitle>
Uh...</subtitle>

Oh, I don't know whyI thought I could do this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:23"><subtitle>
I'm drowning, and cats hate drowning.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:27"><subtitle>
I believe I can take onmore responsibility around here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:29"><subtitle>
- On a provisional basis, of course.- Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:32"><subtitle>
But we're a small agencyand we need to think like one.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:35"><subtitle>
Instead of spreading ourselves thinner,we should focus on better gigsfor the clients we already have.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:40"><subtitle>
- Oh. Like Jerry Maguire.- Yes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:44"><subtitle>

What do you mean, "What's next?"Why does everything have to have a next?</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:15:15"><subtitle>
I just mean, after Secretariat's all over,what are you going to do next?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:19"><subtitle>
We were told this feature would bepegged to the release of Secretariat.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:24"><subtitle>
It is, but we also want to get to knowthe real BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:27"><subtitle>
- Do we?- If you want the real BoJack,there's a book written about that.</subtitle>

That "You Are Secretariat" scene?Oh, it made me wet.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:28"><subtitle>
It made you wet?!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:29"><subtitle>
Yeah. "Wet" is manatee slang.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:31"><subtitle>
It refers to a feelingof comfort and warmth,because a manatee'snatural habitat is water.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:36"><subtitle>
Oh, okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:38"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:17:01"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:40"><subtitle>
I don't want to think about that show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:42"><subtitle>
I didn't come back to your hotel roombecause you're a goofy dad who once gothis dick stuck in a vacuum cleaner.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:48"><subtitle>
I'm pretty surethat never happened on the show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:50"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:18:48"><subtitle>
- What?- In New Mexico.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:51"><subtitle>
And she trusted me.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:18:53"><subtitle>
I keep asking myselfif her mother didn't walk in,would I have done it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:57"><subtitle>
And part of me is surethat I-- I couldn't.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:01"><subtitle>
But another part knows that's a lie.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:04"><subtitle>

Oh, come on, come on.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:50"><subtitle>
I'm aware of the situationand I'm handling it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:53"><subtitle>
- But I haven't even--- I'm handling it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:55"><subtitle>
I'll see you at the screening tonight.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:57"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:59"><subtitle>

<description>Peanutbutter</description>All right, Oxnard.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:18"><subtitle>
We are looking ata once in a lifetime opportunity.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:22"><subtitle>
Too bad Todd's not here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:24"><subtitle>
He's always the bestat coming up with ideasthat at first might seem terrible...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:29"><subtitle>
Right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:30"><subtitle>
If he was here,he'd probably say something like,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:33"><subtitle>
"Hey, you know what's cool?Spaghetti strainers!"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:35"><subtitle>
Go on.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:37"><subtitle>
And you'd say, "I feel likeI've seen that somewhere before."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:40"><subtitle>
Hah! That is so me!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:42"><subtitle>
And then he'd say, "What if I told youthat this spaghetti straineris also a hat?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:48"><subtitle>
A spaghetti strainer that's also a hat?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:52"><subtitle>
That is a brilliant idea!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:54"><subtitle>
That's a terrible idea.That's my point!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:56"><subtitle>
Put that in the maybe pile.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:57"><subtitle>
Right now, we need to focuson TV shows.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:59"><subtitle>
I'm sure Todd would suggest,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:01"><subtitle>
A Spaghetti StrainerThat's Also A Hat: The TV Show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:05"><subtitle>
That's it! Todd, you've done it again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:07"><subtitle>
No! Nobody's done anything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:09"><subtitle>
Oxnard, I want you to buy outthe entire spaghetti strainer warehouse.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:13"><subtitle>
I mean, every spaghetti strainer they got.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:15"><subtitle>
I'm putting all my moneyin spaghetti strainers for this show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:18"><subtitle>

</timestamp>

- <description>vehicle stopping</description>- <description>door opens, closes</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:28"><subtitle>
I took care of our problem.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:30"><subtitle>
What did you do?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:32"><subtitle>
You don't need to know anything else.It's been taken care of.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:35"><subtitle>
Ana...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:37"><subtitle>
There-- There was a momentback at the hotel where...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:40"><subtitle>
I really thought I blew it,I was scared it was all over, and--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:43"><subtitle>
And then after, I was relieved.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:47"><subtitle>
I don't know if I should win an Oscar.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:49"><subtitle>
- I don't know if I want to.- Stop punishing yourself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:52"><subtitle>
I was in New Mexico.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:54"><subtitle>
None of that matters.All that matters now is the story.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:58"><subtitle>
We get to decide what our story is.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:00"><subtitle>
Nobody else gets to tell youwhat your story is.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:03"><subtitle>
- What is my story?- I'll tell you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:05"><subtitle>
This has been your dream for the last30 years. You made it happen.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:09"><subtitle>
An Oscar won't make you happy forever,it won't solve all your problems.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:13"><subtitle>
You win that Oscar,the next day you go back to being you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:17"><subtitle>
But that night is a really good night.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:20"><subtitle>
I think you deserve a really good night,and I know how to get you there.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
