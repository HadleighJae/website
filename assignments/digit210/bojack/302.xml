</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:20"><subtitle>
I would have acceptedThere Will, or Be Blood.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:23"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:26"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:47"><subtitle>
Every little thing I bring that guy,he turns down.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:50"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:28"><subtitle>
I realized I'm only here on this earthfor a bit, why not dig deeper?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:32"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:07:33"><subtitle>
I'm proud of the seven yearsI spent on Krill &amp; Grace.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:36"><subtitle>
That show did so muchfor the way society views krill people.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:39"><subtitle>
That show didn't make me happy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:41"><subtitle>
The awards, the moneydidn't make me happy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:43"><subtitle>
Did you try spending the money on things?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:46"><subtitle>
I started to feel like I was trappedin a giant plastic ball.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:49"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:53"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:15"><subtitle>
I've worked on great showsmy whole career.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:17"><subtitle>
Great shows are easy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:19"><subtitle>
I didn't become president of the Lampoonso I could make "great" shows.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:23"><subtitle>
- Harvard Lampoon.- Yeah, I got it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:25"><subtitle>
I'm trying to do something different here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:27"><subtitle>
- Something that lasts.- Huh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:29"><subtitle>
Think about it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:30"><subtitle>
If you're ready to finally stop being"The Horse" from Horsin' Around,send me an e-mail:Cuddlywhiskers@harvard.edu.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:38"><subtitle>
- That's H-A-R--- I got it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:40"><subtitle>
<description>gasps</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:43"><subtitle>
You got some mail, babe.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:45"><subtitle>
Mwah! You understand I'm usingthat pet name ironically, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:49"><subtitle>
Yes, Wayne.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:50"><subtitle>
Oh, my God, check it out,a rejection letter from The New Yorker.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:54"><subtitle>
That magazine is for white people.White people are the worst, right, guys?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:59"><subtitle>
Yup.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:00"><subtitle>
"Dear Diane.We are sorry to say that your piece,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:03"><subtitle>
'An Open Letter to Open Letters',wasn't right for us,despite its evident merit."Do you know what this means?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:09"><subtitle>
Caring leads to disappointment?Trying is stupid and so is having dreams?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:13"><subtitle>
Someone gave my piece a readand decided against it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:16"><subtitle>
Their journalistic stylecouldn't be more outmoded.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:19"><subtitle>
- Satire? More like "sa-tired."- I never even thought they'd read it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:23"><subtitle>
"Talk of the Town"?More like "Schlock of the Clown".</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:27"><subtitle>
Then they typed me a letterthat said it had "obvious merit".</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:31"><subtitle>
"Shouts and Murmurs"?More like "Louts and..."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:34"><subtitle>
What rhymes with murmurs?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:35"><subtitle>
For two peoplewho don't like The New Yorker,you know a lot about the differentsections of The New Yorker.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:42"><subtitle>
And then Cuddlywhiskers said:</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:43"><subtitle>
"What if we stopped thinking of TVas a conduit to tell storiesand thinking of itas a conduit to tell truth?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:48"><subtitle>
And I was like: "Damn, this guymust have gone to Yale or something."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:52"><subtitle>
Sounds like you two really hit it off.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:54"><subtitle>
We were like Heidi and Spencerup in there.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:56"><subtitle>
So you're gonna do the show?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:58"><subtitle>
- Nah. Timing's really off right now.- <description>sighs</description>iPhone's coming out this year,I need to gear up for that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:03"><subtitle>
I'm done. That's it, I'm tiredof bending over backwards for you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:06"><subtitle>
I mean this in all seriousness,professionally or in bed?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:09"><subtitle>
Why won't you do this?Give me one good reason.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:11"><subtitle>
Because his show sounds incredible.And what if... I'm not?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:17"><subtitle>
What if there's a reason the only thingI'm known for is Horsin' Around?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:20"><subtitle>
BoJack, you are amazing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:23"><subtitle>
You're bright and you're funnyand you're handsome and you're talented.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:27"><subtitle>
But if you can't see that,then you're the biggest,dumbest piece of shit in the world.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:35"><subtitle>
- <description>pop music playing</description>- <description>laughter and chatter</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:40"><subtitle>
How long do we have to stay in here?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:42"><subtitle>
- It's called Seven Minutes in Heaven.- Uh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:44"><subtitle>
We don't have to kiss.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:46"><subtitle>
I know you'd rather be in herewith Kimber.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:48"><subtitle>
That's not true. It's just that, Emily...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:51"><subtitle>
- What?- I've never kissed anyone before.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:54"><subtitle>
That's okay.Maybe we can try with each other?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:57"><subtitle>
That way, when you're in here with Kimberone day, you'll know exactly what to do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:00"><subtitle>
Okay, so how should we do it?French style, Eskimo, Butterfly?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:06"><subtitle>
I'll tell you. I know exactly what to dobecause I practice all the timewith a picture of Adam Brody--No, I don't!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:11"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:12"><subtitle>
Just close your eyes,and we move our faces toward each other.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:10"><subtitle>
<description>groans</description> That's the worst part of America.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:12"><subtitle>
Other than the bottom,the top and most of the sides.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:15"><subtitle>
BoJack, Cuddlywhiskers,what can we say?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:18"><subtitle>
This is why you guys are the prosand we're just the schmoes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:22"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:26"><subtitle>
Enough with the torture.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:27"><subtitle>
Don't have to feed me to finger me.Just lay on the notes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:29"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:32"><subtitle>

Huh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:43"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:49"><subtitle>
- It was so funny.- Wow.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:51"><subtitle>
It seems like you're reallyin sync with this Justin guy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:54"><subtitle>
You should do all the thingswith him that I can't do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:57"><subtitle>
Like eat chocolate,or enjoy fireworks, or watch tennis.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:01"><subtitle>
Why, tennis makes me so mad.Why doesn't anyone ever catch the ball?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:05"><subtitle>
Hello? Can we please getsome service in this place?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:08"><subtitle>
I'm famous actress Jessica Biel.I'm one of the Jessicas.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:12"><subtitle>
Mom, I'm finally gonna bea published writer.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:15"><subtitle>
My "Open Letter to Open Letters"is going to be published in McSweeney's.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:18"><subtitle>
Mc-What? Who's that? Some Irish?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:21"><subtitle>
No, Mom. It's a very popular website.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:24"><subtitle>
Oh, no, no, no, no.I'm not falling for that scam.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:26"><subtitle>
Website? We gotta print it outon our own paper with our own ink?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:30"><subtitle>
- I don't think so.- Mom.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:31"><subtitle>
And my Blockbuster original serieshas been keeping me very busy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:35"><subtitle>
I still don't get how that's gonna work,at all.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:37"><subtitle>
Babe, it makes total sense.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:39"><subtitle>
They make the whole season,put it on six DVD's.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:42"><subtitle>
People go to their local Blockbuster Videoand rent it out one disc at a timefor five days each.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:47"><subtitle>
What if someone already rentedthe episodes they want?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:49"><subtitle>
They can just get something else,like The Illusionist or The Prestige.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:53"><subtitle>
- Whichever one you were in.- Do you know which one?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:55"><subtitle>
- Do you?- <description>groans</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:58"><subtitle>
- Why do you say yes to everything?- I get excited by the possibilities.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:03"><subtitle>
Look, a CD, at a coffee shop?That is crazy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:06"><subtitle>
- Buying it.- Eh-eh eh-eh! No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:08"><subtitle>
- Drop it. Drop it.- <description>whimpers</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:10"><subtitle>
Good boy.</subtitle>

Yoo-hoo! I also heard that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:21"><subtitle>
Exactly. The network loved it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:23"><subtitle>
Obviously, we're playing it too safe.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:25"><subtitle>
If you want my opinion, fellas,you hit oil, stop drilling.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:28"><subtitle>
"I am an oil man.I drink your milkshake."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:32"><subtitle>
- That'll be funny in a year or so.- Before that got sad and weird,you said, "If you want my opinion,"and we don't.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:38"><subtitle>
Cuddlywhiskers, you told meyou wanted to do something different.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:41"><subtitle>
Now we're doing something that's gonna be"just as good as Horsin' Around."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:44"><subtitle>
Is that what you wanted?That's not why I'm here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:47"><subtitle>
- I know.- I really think you're making a mistake.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:49"><subtitle>
I'm not taking career advicefrom somebody who's beenan assistant the last 14 years.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:53"><subtitle>
Is that how you think of me?As your agent's assistant?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:56"><subtitle>
- What do you think you are?- I don't know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:59"><subtitle>
Here's some free advice:you should know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:01"><subtitle>
Why don't you leave this to the grown-ups?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:03"><subtitle>
Somebody needs coffee,I'll give you a ring.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:22"><subtitle>
I gotta go. What do you want, Toots?</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:45"><subtitle>
- What?- Who needs the headache?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:46"><subtitle>
Thirty years I threw into this joband it destroyed me from the inside out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:53"><subtitle>
I never fell in love,I never had a family.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:57"><subtitle>
I never even got to give that lacy teddyto the mean woman who worked at the DMV.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:03"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description> All I have is regrets.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

First thing I'm gonna dois get rid of that ceiling fan.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:21"><subtitle>
How do we make it clearthat this isn't Horsin' Around?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:25"><subtitle>
What if in the very first scene,we show my characterliterally taking a massive dumpon a VHS copy of Horsin' Around?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:33"><subtitle>
What? That's insane.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:35"><subtitle>
Let's just put it in,we can always take it out later.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:38"><subtitle>
I want this character to be really edgy,the kind of character Denis Learywould be offered and then say:</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:43"><subtitle>
"This character's too edgy for me."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:45"><subtitle>
What if he had a catchphrasethat was an anti-catchphrase?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:47"><subtitle>
Like if every time he entered the roomhe was like, "Whassup, bitches?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:52"><subtitle>
Not that, because that's horrible.But something like that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:55"><subtitle>
Whassup, bitches?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:56"><subtitle>
