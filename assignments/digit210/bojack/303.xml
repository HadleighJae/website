Ohh! It smells like a skunkskunked another skunk in here,then they smoked a joint.What happened?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:36"><subtitle>
First I rolled all over the couchto get the skunk stench out,but that did not work.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:41"><subtitle>
Then I ran into every room to rub myselfon all my clothes and belongings,to get the Mr. Peanutbutter smell back.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:47"><subtitle>
And then I smoked a joint,so that might bewhy it smells like skunk in here.</subtitle>

And then when I filled our entire housewith these giant cratesof spaghetti strainers, that did not help.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:03"><subtitle>
Why buy these spaghetti strainersin the first place?</subtitle>
</timestamp>

- <description>gasps</description>- BoJack?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:25"><subtitle>
Mmm.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:26"><subtitle>
After The BoJack Horseman Showfell apart, I got depressed a long time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:30"><subtitle>
Sure, I wrote a bunch of hit movies,I made a ton of money,but it wasn't fulfilling.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:34"><subtitle>
I remember when I won my Oscar,standing up on that stage,looking at the statue and thought,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:39"><subtitle>
"This is supposed to bethe happiest moment of my life."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:41"><subtitle>
And I never felt more miserable.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:43"><subtitle>
- Oh. Because you're sober?- Because an Oscar is meaningless.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:46"><subtitle>
It's all meaningless.I dedicated myself to helping others.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:49"><subtitle>
I turned my home into a halfway housefor troubled addicts.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:52"><subtitle>
I had this system for recovery,and it helped a lot of them,but even more slipped through the cracks.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:58"><subtitle>
That, too, left me empty.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:00"><subtitle>
Everyone was worried about you,you know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:02"><subtitle>
You can't just disappear.You really hurt a lot of people.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:05"><subtitle>
Sometimes you need to take responsibilityfor your own happiness.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:08"><subtitle>
You don't think that's a little selfish?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:10"><subtitle>
I don't know what to tell you.I'm happy, for the first time in my life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:14"><subtitle>
I'm not gonna feel bad about it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:15"><subtitle>
It takes a long time to realizehow truly miserable you are,even longer to seeit doesn't have to be that way.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:22"><subtitle>
Only after you give up everythingcan you begin to find a way to be happy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:35"><subtitle>
Can you believe that guy?What a nut, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:39"><subtitle>
I just wanna go home.</subtitle>
