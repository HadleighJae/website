</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:29"><subtitle>
How do I get out of this conversation?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:30"><subtitle>
Just think: by this time tomorrow,we'll know if it's a hit or a flop.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:35"><subtitle>
The air crackles with possibilities.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:37"><subtitle>
- Oh, good lord. <description>groaning</description>- Uh-oh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:40"><subtitle>
It's all over. My career is gone.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:44"><subtitle>
I'm sure it's going to be fine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:46"><subtitle>
Wasn't Secretariat a big hitat the Pacific Ocean Film Festival?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:50"><subtitle>
Critics called it,"Gurgle glub glub blub blub."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:52"><subtitle>
Festivals don't matter, Todd.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:54"><subtitle>
It's so you can get some leaveson your poster.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:56"><subtitle>
But this is the real world now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:58"><subtitle>
If this doesn't hit big this weekend--</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:14"><subtitle>
- a huge success!- Why would you make me wait for it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:16"><subtitle>
That was a terrible timefor a "wait for it."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:19"><subtitle>
Do you know what this means?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:20"><subtitle>
You're no longer just some TV actorthey threw into a movie,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:24"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:28"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:02:28"><subtitle>
We defy odds,we face challenges with valor,and we never give in.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:35"><subtitle>
For those reasons, and many more,our love is like the teamthat inspired the movie Cool Runnings.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:42"><subtitle>
If I may borrowthat film's promotional tag line,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:45"><subtitle>
"Jamaican Bobsledders?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:47"><subtitle>
That's right, Diane."Jamaican bobsledders."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:50"><subtitle>
Thank you, Mr. Peanutbutter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:52"><subtitle>
Thank you, Dr. Janet,for Jamaican me open up like that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:55"><subtitle>
That took up most of the hour,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:57"><subtitle>
but we do still have a little timeto hear from Diane.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:01"><subtitle>
Mr. Peanutbutter, I think you are great.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:07"><subtitle>
- Is that all?- I'm sorry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:09"><subtitle>
I'm not always good at using wordsto describe emotions.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:12"><subtitle>
Aren't you a writer?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:14"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:03:18"><subtitle>
- <description>alarm blaring</description>- Aah!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:19"><subtitle>
That gentle sound tells us the sun has seton our time together this week.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:24"><subtitle>
But I remind youof the importance of communication.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:28"><subtitle>
It's the very blade of the bobsled.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:31"><subtitle>
I'm not singling out either one of you,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:33"><subtitle>
but I think for the next time,some people here</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:36"><subtitle>
might want to work on puttingtheir thoughts and feelings into words,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:40"><subtitle>
as a writer does.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:42"><subtitle>
- Mmm?- Mm-mmm.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:44"><subtitle>
- Ah.- <description>sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:48"><subtitle>
I settled on a company dental plan.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:50"><subtitle>
It's called, "The tooth, the whole tooth,and nothing but the tooth."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:53"><subtitle>
- Seemed comprehensive.- Not "tooth" shabby, Judah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:56"><subtitle>

</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:06"><subtitle>
Yeah, what's up?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:07"><subtitle>
I've taken on duties beyond the scopeof my original contract.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:10"><subtitle>
- I think I've proven my worth.- Are you asking for a raise?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:13"><subtitle>
A more elegant solution might involvean ownership position in the company.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:16"><subtitle>
I thought I'd ask for 15 percent stake,you'd counter with five,we'd settle on ten.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:20"><subtitle>
- Well, then, it's settled.- I'll draw up the paperwork.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:22"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:30"><subtitle>
- Can I help you with anything else?- Get me a date for tonight.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:33"><subtitle>
Make that three dates.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:35"><subtitle>
Who knows when I'll get another night off?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:37"><subtitle>
I do. And you won't.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:39"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description></subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:21"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:56"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:58"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:01"><subtitle>
I was laughing at itbecause it was so bad, do you understand?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:04"><subtitle>
- You're being very clear.- I feel like I'm not articulating.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:07"><subtitle>
My enjoyment didn't comefrom a place of sincere admiration.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:10"><subtitle>
It was more like,"What an ill-conceived television show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:13"><subtitle>
Who made those terrible choices?I can't stop watching."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:16"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:29"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:06:32"><subtitle>
Boring regular people love itwhen movie stars show upand drink their alcohol.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

They jizz their pants for that shit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:38"><subtitle>
- I don't know, BoJack.- I'm sorry, Todd. Are you a movie star?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:41"><subtitle>
I did narrate a Mazda commercial.Funny story how that came together.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:48"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:54"><subtitle>
It just doesn't come easy for me,like it does for you.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:01"><subtitle>

You had a house filled with love,parents who said nice things to you,and the beautiful verdant hillsidesof the Labrador Peninsula.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:11"><subtitle>
I didn't have Diane Peninsula.I had the Isthmus of Assholes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:15"><subtitle>
I keep telling youwe should go visit the old country.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:18"><subtitle>
You'd love it up there.There's so much to smell.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:21"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description> That's weird.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:22"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:42"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:43"><subtitle>
I hoped we could snuggle upon the couch and watch Bones.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:46"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:48"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:29"><subtitle>
I can't go on three dates.Can we reschedule two of them?</subtitle>
</timestamp>

Especially since you have those lawyerscoming next week to change light bulbs.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:39"><subtitle>
Okay, I just realized nowthat was also a joke.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:45"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:46"><subtitle>

On the way here, the driver stoppedin some weird parking lotand asked if he could touch my hair.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:54"><subtitle>
- That's terrifying.- I know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:56"><subtitle>
It is a very popular ride-sharing app,you'd think they could vettheir drivers better.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:00"><subtitle>
Which app is that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:00"><subtitle>
I probably shouldn't say,for legal reasons.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:03"><subtitle>
I think we all knowwhich one I'm talking about.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:06"><subtitle>
You know what would solvea lot of problems?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:09"><subtitle>
If there was a ride-share app for womenthat only had women drivers.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:13"><subtitle>
That is such a good idea, Todd.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:16"><subtitle>
- You always did have such great ideas.- You know what else would be cool?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:19"><subtitle>
A miniature cupcake gun,so you could shoot tiny cupcakesinto your mouth.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:24"><subtitle>
"Uh-oh! Is that guytrying to kill himself?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:27"><subtitle>
"Nope, just a cupcake gun."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:29"><subtitle>
Wait, no, go back to your other idea.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:31"><subtitle>
- Which one?- The one about the women drivers.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:34"><subtitle>
Taneisha, and Karen.<description>sobbing</description> Karen and Taneisha.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:46"><subtitle>

</timestamp>

Yeah, Diane, some drug dealer from 2013found a time machineand gave us this Molly.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:04"><subtitle>
- Nobody does Molly anymore.- This is Gush.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:07"><subtitle>
What's Gush?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:08"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description> Look, Diane, I get thatthis is maybe not your usual scene.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:12"><subtitle>
- So don't feel like you have to do any--- No, no, I can hang. Let's do drugs.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:16"><subtitle>
Let's put the drug in my mouth,so I can trip or roll or gush or--</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:33"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:44"><subtitle>
- Yes.- Who's comfortable in her own skin.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:47"><subtitle>
I always say, there's more than one wayfor a cat... you know, to have skin.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:51"><subtitle>
And has come to termswith not having children.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:54"><subtitle>
What makes you thinkI don't want to have children?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:57"><subtitle>
Oh, come on.What are you, serious? At your age?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:59"><subtitle>
Since when are you an experton who can and cannot have children?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:03"><subtitle>
I'm a gynecologist.I specialize in fertility.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:06"><subtitle>
I'd be happy to put you in the stirrups,look at the old cat eggs.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:09"><subtitle>
Ecch! Not if you were the last albinorhino gyno on the planet.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:13"><subtitle>
I'm the only albino rhino gyno I know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:15"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:19"><subtitle>
Oh, yeah!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:21"><subtitle>
So to do a soft launch,I think we'd only need about ten cars.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:24"><subtitle>
I could work out any bugs with the app.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:26"><subtitle>
You really know what you're talking about.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:29"><subtitle>
So, do you thinkyour girlfriend would get jealousif we started this project together, or...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:33"><subtitle>
Oh, God, this is so embarrassing for you,but I actually don't have a girlfriend.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:38"><subtitle>
That's a really weird assumptionfor you to make.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:41"><subtitle>
You look really dumb right now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:43"><subtitle>
No, actually, I was kind of hopingyou weren't seeing anybody.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:05"><subtitle>

About how when you know, you know.</subtitle>

And I'm sitting there,and I'm thinking, "Do I know?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:37"><subtitle>
- Uh...- I mean, I think I know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:39"><subtitle>
But if you know when you knowand I only think that I know,maybe that means that I don't know, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:44"><subtitle>
- Oh, boy.- Karen, I'm sorry.</subtitle>

You're the cool kids. I'm the nerd.I should have known.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:08"><subtitle>
So I texted the wrong person. So what?This isn't high school.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:12"><subtitle>
There's no nerds and no cool kids.We're all adults.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

We're hanging out togetherand having a good time.</subtitle>

Did I say something? Is it becauseI asked for the glass of milk?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:08"><subtitle>
- If you give me a cookie--- No, you're great.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:10"><subtitle>
It's just running an agencydoesn't give me a lot of nights off.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:13"><subtitle>
Tell you what, here's my card.If you're ever free, give me a call.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:31"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:20:34"><subtitle>
Nobody should be thinkingabout the things I say.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:20:36"><subtitle>
- I love Karen. But does she complete me?- Taneisha, nobody completes anybody.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:41"><subtitle>
That's not a real thing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:43"><subtitle>
If you're lucky enough to find someoneyou can halfway tolerate,sink your nails in and don't let go,no matter what.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:48"><subtitle>
- So, what, I should just settle?- Yes, thank you, exactly. Settle.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:52"><subtitle>
Because otherwise you're just gonnaget older, and harder, and more alone.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:56"><subtitle>
And you're gonna do everything you canto fill that hole, with friends,and your career, and meaningless sex,but the hole doesn't get filled.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:05"><subtitle>
One day, you're gonna look aroundand you're going to realizethat everybody loves you,but nobody likes you.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:04"><subtitle>
Yeah, I know.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:22:05"><subtitle>
And sometimes I think that I know myself,but maybe that's a trap.</subtitle>
