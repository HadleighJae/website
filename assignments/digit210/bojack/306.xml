</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:18"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:20"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:23"><subtitle>
A streetwise but soulful teenneeded somewhere to liveas he waitedfor his Juilliard audition.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:26"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:29"><subtitle>
-But a baby? Are you--?-It's not about me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:32"><subtitle>
There's no "I" in uterus,there's only "us."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:34"><subtitle>
And "U," and another "U,"but that's the "U" that's in "us,"so I already said that "U."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:40"><subtitle>
The point is,I'm going to be here for you, 24/7.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:43"><subtitle>
Two hundred and forty-seven percent,that's how "there for you" I'll be.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:48"><subtitle>
-Whatever you decide...-What we decide, because this is--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:50"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:03:31"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:32"><subtitle>
Can you look at rainbows on your phone?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:34"><subtitle>
Shut up, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:36"><subtitle>
-<description>phone pinging</description>-Shit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:37"><subtitle>
I just tweeted "Shut up, BoJack,"as Cynthia Nixon.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:40"><subtitle>
I'd buy it. She is not a fan,and for good reason.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:42"><subtitle>
-We were up in the Poconos, she and I...-BoJack, not now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:45"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:50"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:52"><subtitle>
started a family, lived a fruitful life,and then died up your butt.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:55"><subtitle>
I'm getting an abortion.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:56"><subtitle>
Whoa, that takes me back.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:58"><subtitle>
I had more than my share of abortionsin the '90s.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:01"><subtitle>
I didn't get them, I paid for them.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:02"><subtitle>
I really hope all those womenactually got the abortions,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:05"><subtitle>
and didn't just keep my money.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:07"><subtitle>
Diane, are you tweeting for pop starletSextina Aquafina right now?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:11"><subtitle>
I'm trying to. Why?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:12"><subtitle>
Because her accountjust tweeted out to 40 million followers,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:15"><subtitle>
"I'm getting an abortion."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:17"><subtitle>

She--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:19"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:26"><subtitle>
And the world says, "Whaaa?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:30"><subtitle>
If it's happening,we're gonna talk about it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:32"><subtitle>
It's time for Tom's Rant.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:34"><subtitle>
Is Twitter an appropriate forumto be discussing a sensitive issuelike abortion?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:39"><subtitle>
Wouldn't a better forum be nowhere?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:42"><subtitle>
Wait, does that say "Tom Srant"?Why does that say Tom Srant?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:46"><subtitle>
I clearly said--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:47"><subtitle>
Randy, don't look at Jessica.This is on you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:52"><subtitle>
Diane, VIM is hanging on by a threadand only barely scraping bybecause of clients like Sextina.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:58"><subtitle>
Hey! Heard you pulled the triggeron the Big Bear condo.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:01"><subtitle>
Great investment.We are not on the edge of complete ruin.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:04"><subtitle>
We are on the edge of complete ruin.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:06"><subtitle>
I think if I explain it to herand apologize, she'll understand.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:10"><subtitle>
Because she's so understanding?This is a teenage pop star.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:13"><subtitle>
Literally the two leastcompassionate entitiescombined into the supernovaof not understanding</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:18"><subtitle>
-that is Sextina Aquafina.-<description>elevator dings</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:22"><subtitle>
Ugh. So imagine my surprisewhen I'm in the middle of a performancefor Gaddafi's cousin on his yachtand I'm in a giant champagne flutesinging "Left Titty"and everyone starts to lookat their phones and look at me,because I am apparently aborting a babyI do not have.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:39"><subtitle>
So I had them turn their boat into a carand drive me here to fire someone.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:44"><subtitle>
-I think that's me.-Great. You're fired, Glasses.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:47"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:53"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:54"><subtitle>
What "oh?" Who said you could "Oh?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:56"><subtitle>
Taylor Swift just tweetedthat you were "brave."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:59"><subtitle>
Nicki Minaj tweeted at youa face with heart eyes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:02"><subtitle>
And BuzzFeed just posted a listof top 15 celebritieswho should have had abortionslike Sextina.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:07"><subtitle>
-You're trending like crazy.-I'm trending?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:11"><subtitle>
Most women who go through thisnever talk about itbecause it's so stigmatized.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:14"><subtitle>
The fact that you're coming out like thisis huge.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:17"><subtitle>
It would be, if you wereactually getting an abortion.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:19"><subtitle>
So what you're saying is,maybe I am getting an abortion?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:24"><subtitle>
Well, no, because you're not.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:26"><subtitle>
Yeah, but if you did,this would make you a cultural icon.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:29"><subtitle>
Glasses, you're un-fired.I'm getting an abortion.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:33"><subtitle>
-Well...-I gotta go on talk shows.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:35"><subtitle>
If I can make one womanfeel a little less alone,then it's all worth it, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:40"><subtitle>
Yeah...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:41"><subtitle>
And if I can make a million womenbuy my album,then it's definitely all worth it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:45"><subtitle>
Um...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:46"><subtitle>
-Diane, take the yes.-Okay.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:56"><subtitle>
<description>crowd chattering</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:59"><subtitle>
So, before the procedure,you'll need to look at an ultrasoundand listen to the heartbeat.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:04"><subtitle>
Or heartbeats, if you're having a litter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:06"><subtitle>
Why does she have to listento the heartbeat?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:07"><subtitle>
It's the law. Also, by law,I have to tell you that at one month,your puppies have a favorite colorand that color may be blue.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:14"><subtitle>
-That can't be true.-By law, I have to tell you that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:17"><subtitle>
Also, before your procedure,you'll need to watch20 hours of cute puppy videosas Sarah McLachlan's"I Will Remember You" plays softly.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:24"><subtitle>
Don't worry, Diane, I will watchthe cute puppy videos for you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:27"><subtitle>
-It's a sacrifice I'm willing to make.-No, she has to watch the videos.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:30"><subtitle>
Don't worry, Diane, we will watchthe cute puppy videos together.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:04"><subtitle>
You know,I don't think of him as a war criminal.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:07"><subtitle>
I just think of him as a personwho had a funny accent.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:10"><subtitle>
Totally. I think I'm gettingthe hang of all this now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:13"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:06"><subtitle>
Someone put a baby in your bellyand now you're like,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:09"><subtitle>
"Awooga!Is there an undo button around here?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:11"><subtitle>
Leggo my preggo."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:13"><subtitle>
-Is that right?-That is exactly correct, A Ryan,but I am very excited for this opportunityto put a face on this important issue.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:20"><subtitle>
One out of three womenwill have an abortion in her life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:23"><subtitle>
That sounds crazy high to me,I don't buy it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:26"><subtitle>
I wanted to destigmatize the experiencefor all women out there,so I'm dropping a new single.</subtitle>

Christ, stop the tape.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:00"><subtitle>
Glasses, you did this.You empowered me to tell my story.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:04"><subtitle>
I think the tone might be a little severe?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:09"><subtitle>
Look, when you get an abortion,you can express yourself however you want,but this is about my body and my choices,and my choiceis to be a totally insane badass.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:19"><subtitle>
Ugh! I am getting an abortion.You're not even really pregnant.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:22"><subtitle>
So? This is show business."Brrap brrap. Pew pew."</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:34"><subtitle>
But has the concept of womenhaving choices gone too far?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:37"><subtitle>
We've assembled this diverse panelof white men in bow ties</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:40"><subtitle>
to talk about abortion. Gentlemen?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:42"><subtitle>
Tom, this is not just a woman's issue.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:45"><subtitle>
I'm a man, but if I got pregnant,</subtitle>

Millennials today think everything is NBD.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

NBD of course stands for No BD,referring to B.D. Wong,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:07"><subtitle>
who teens think is a very big deal.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:09"><subtitle>
So if something's not BD,it means it's not a big deal.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:14"><subtitle>
-These days, abortions are not BD.-Are abortions even necessary?</subtitle>
</timestamp>

I heard a theory that if a womanreally has an unwanted pregnancy,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:23"><subtitle>
the body has a way to break the fetus downinto gas particles</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:26"><subtitle>
and then she can just fart it out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:28"><subtitle>
Where did you hear this intriguing"fart it out" theory?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:31"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:42"><subtitle>
I agree with you, 247 percent.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:44"><subtitle>
I just wrote "morally bankrupt"on this form.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:47"><subtitle>
You were right to do that.This form is being very nosy right now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:50"><subtitle>
Why did I even take that job?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:52"><subtitle>
You were going through a rough time,Princess Carolyn wanted to help youand she offered you the job.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:19:57"><subtitle>
Which she should not have done.So morally bankrupt.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:16"><subtitle>
Is that really a good idea?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:18"><subtitle>
It is if you think it is,because I am here to support youno matter what,but maybe it isn't the best idea?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:25"><subtitle>
Like, if that idea were a Dillon brothermaybe it's a Kevin, not a Matt?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:30"><subtitle>
