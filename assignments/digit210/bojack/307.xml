</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:18"><subtitle>
Guy's name is BoJack Horseman.He's pretty steamed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:20"><subtitle>
I've tried everything, but we might needto bring the Closer in on this one.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:24"><subtitle>
Calm down. We can sort this outwithout having to get the Closer involved.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:27"><subtitle>
Did you offer 26 weeksat 50 percent off the newsstand price?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:30"><subtitle>
I went through the entire checklist, sir.Even offered him a free tote bag.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:33"><subtitle>
What kind of monster says noto a tote bag? Good work, rep.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

I never subscribed to the L.A. Gazette.I do not read the L.A. Gazette.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:10"><subtitle>
I have called this number so many timesto stop sending it to me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:14"><subtitle>
Yet every morning, I open my dooron a new edition of the L.A. Gazette.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:17"><subtitle>
It's like I'm in a boring episodeof The Twilight Zone.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:20"><subtitle>
Sir, we are going to unravel this mystery.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:22"><subtitle>
But before we dig in,is there anything I can get you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:26"><subtitle>
A glass of ice water perhaps?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:28"><subtitle>
Yeah, sure, I'd love a glass of ice water.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:30"><subtitle>
Fabulous. Johnny will get that to youin three, two, one...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:35"><subtitle>
-<description>drone whirring</description>-Uh... huh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:38"><subtitle>
I see you've been receivingour paper for six months,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:42"><subtitle>
but there's no record of youever registering a complaint.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:46"><subtitle>
From whence the hostility, counselor?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:48"><subtitle>
It wasn't a problem until recently,because up until a week ago</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:51"><subtitle>
the boy who lives with me used the paperto make a giant paper-mâché Todd head.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:55"><subtitle>
-What was that?-I live with my best friend, Todd.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:57"><subtitle>
Good kid, but sometimeshe gets ideas to do things.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:00"><subtitle>
<description>groaning, screaming</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:03"><subtitle>
-Pretty scary, right?-Yes. What the hell is that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:07"><subtitle>
Giant Todd Head, of course.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:08"><subtitle>
I've been working on himfor the last six months.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:11"><subtitle>
What? Why?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:12"><subtitle>
It all startedwhen a rustling from the kitchen</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:15"><subtitle>
jostled me from tender slumber.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:19"><subtitle>
-<description>blinds rattling</description>-<description>panting</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:20"><subtitle>
Uh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:25"><subtitle>
What was that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:29"><subtitle>
<description>gasping</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:32"><subtitle>
If there's a ghost present,please do not screamor have a skull face or be wearinga tattered white satin gown.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:40"><subtitle>
<description>gasping</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:42"><subtitle>
Someone or something is stealing our food.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:46"><subtitle>
I made a giant papier-mâché Todd headto scare it away. Think it'll work?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:51"><subtitle>
If I made a giant papier-mâché me head,would you stop eating my food?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:54"><subtitle>
You should take this seriously.We might have an infestation.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:56"><subtitle>
We do have an infestation, of Todds.Look at that, they're getting bigger.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:00"><subtitle>
And? Did the head help to ameliorateyour pest peccadillo?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:04"><subtitle>
No. Todd abandoned the project as soonas he started working on Cabracadabra.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:08"><subtitle>
-What's Cabracadabra?-That's what I said.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:10"><subtitle>
-What's Cabracadabra?-That's what I said.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:13"><subtitle>
-What's Cabracadabra?-That's what we want you to say.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:16"><subtitle>
If I didn't know any better,you were about to pitch an idea.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:19"><subtitle>
-We are about to pitch you an idea.-I did not know better.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:24"><subtitle>
Has this ever happened to you?Hey, where you headed?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:28"><subtitle>
Oh, yes. That happens to me all the time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:31"><subtitle>
-We're not at the main part yet.-I'm so sorry. Please continue.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:34"><subtitle>
-To the opera, good sir.-Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:36"><subtitle>
Am I watching to see if the whole thinghas happened to me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:39"><subtitle>
-Or looking for one specific thing?-Kind of both.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:41"><subtitle>
So I just keep watching until I seesomething that has happened to me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:46"><subtitle>
-Yes.-What if we get to the end,none of it has ever happened to me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:49"><subtitle>
Maybe just try to put yourselfin Emily's shoes right now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:52"><subtitle>
Got it. Sorry for the interruption.Please continue.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:54"><subtitle>
-So, is this where you live?-Yes, it is.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:57"><subtitle>
-Alone or are you in a relationship?-This hardly seems appropriate.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:01"><subtitle>
Driver, you're startingto make me feel uncomfortable.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:05"><subtitle>
Yeah, Todd. What are you doing?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:08"><subtitle>
Has a creepy driverever given you his numberor told you that you reminded himof his dead girlfriend?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:15"><subtitle>
Or repeated your address slowly,like he was trying to memorize it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:18"><subtitle>
-No, never.-Unfortunately, if you are a womanall those thingswould happen to you every day.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:25"><subtitle>
That's right, Todd.According to my own research,nine out of ten menare total dirtbag creeps, just the worst.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:32"><subtitle>
But what if there was a ride-share servicethat could guaranteeno creepy men driversbecause there are no men drivers at all?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:40"><subtitle>
What are you saying, robot drivers?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:41"><subtitle>
What if they become sentientand try to murder us, or unionize?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:45"><subtitle>
That could be a real headache.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:46"><subtitle>
No, not murderous robots. Women.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:50"><subtitle>
Todd, you have done it again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:52"><subtitle>
Actually, Emily and Icame up with it together.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:55"><subtitle>
Todd and Emily,you've done it again for the first time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:58"><subtitle>
And that's why we're setting up shopat your house.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:02"><subtitle>
Why does it have to be my house?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:04"><subtitle>
There's no roomat Mr. Peanutbutter's house.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:06"><subtitle>
It's full of spaghetti strainers.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:08"><subtitle>
-Why?-Who can recall?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:10"><subtitle>
I figure the longer they're there,the bigger the payoff.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:12"><subtitle>
And they've been sitting therefor months now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:15"><subtitle>
So you can betthe payoff's going to be pretty huge.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:19"><subtitle>
<description>The Closer</description>So, why did you let them use your house?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:22"><subtitle>
Hey, Todd, where do you want this...?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:24"><subtitle>
<description>both</description>Uh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:26"><subtitle>
<description>BoJack</description> I felt guilty.<description>The Closer</description> About what?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:27"><subtitle>
<description>BoJack</description> Todd had this old girlfriend.I met her a couple weeks back.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:31"><subtitle>
-Hey.-Hey.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:38"><subtitle>
-What are you still doing up?-I got thirsty.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:41"><subtitle>
Then you came to the right place.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:44"><subtitle>
Should we call Todd,see if he wants to join us?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:46"><subtitle>
I'm tired of trying to figure outwhat Todd wants.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:49"><subtitle>
And what do you want?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:51"><subtitle>
-I'll start with a whiskey.-My kind of girl.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:54"><subtitle>
-So then we had sex.-What? Why?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:56"><subtitle>
I was lonely? She was there?Why does anyone have sex with anyone?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:00"><subtitle>
Intimacy, affection, a deep needto connect to the world at large.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:04"><subtitle>
The same reasons three million peoplesubscribe to the L.A. Gazette.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:08"><subtitle>
-What?-I'm getting ahead of myself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:10"><subtitle>
Please, continue your story.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:12"><subtitle>
<description>exhaling</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:13"><subtitle>
-You should go.-Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:14"><subtitle>
That was a mistake.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:16"><subtitle>
Agreed. A wonderful, sexy mistakefor you and a regular mistake for me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:19"><subtitle>
No, it was a regular mistake for me, too.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:21"><subtitle>
-What are we gonna tell Todd?-Nothing, obviously.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:25"><subtitle>
-I don't want to hurt him.-Neither do I.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:27"><subtitle>
-That's why we won't tell him.-I feel like we should tell him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:30"><subtitle>
That feeling is you selfishlytrying to assuage your guilt.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:32"><subtitle>
If you cared about Todd,you would keep this a secret forever.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:35"><subtitle>
I'm not good at lying.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:37"><subtitle>
Ask me if when I was a little girl,did I ever used to put a stuffed animalin my underpantsand rock back and forth on it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:43"><subtitle>
When you were a little girl,did you ever do that thing you said?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:45"><subtitle>
What? Get-- <description>stammers</description> No!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:49"><subtitle>
I think it's gonna be fine.Why would it even come up?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:52"><subtitle>
Not like there's any reasonthe three of uswould ever be in a room together again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:56"><subtitle>
BoJack, you remember Emily, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:58"><subtitle>
-I've never seen you before in my life.-No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:01"><subtitle>
-You don't remember BoJack?-Oh, yeah. BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:04"><subtitle>
What... why... What are you here?Why are you doing at Todd's house?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:07"><subtitle>
Todd's house? This is my house.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:09"><subtitle>
It's cool if we set up shop here, right?That's not gonna be weird?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:12"><subtitle>
What? Why would that be weird?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:14"><subtitle>
-What are you implying?-Nothing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:16"><subtitle>
It's not weird for me either,if we're keeping track of weirdnesses.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:19"><subtitle>
-Okay, what is going on here?-Why would you? I don't even--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:23"><subtitle>
-Literally nothing going on.-No, something's going on.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:26"><subtitle>
I've got a nose for news.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:27"><subtitle>
In this case, Nu is the Greek letterrepresenting the variablefor "What Is Going On?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:32"><subtitle>
So let's solve for Nu, shall we?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:34"><subtitle>
I think someone's not saying somethingto someone else about something.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:39"><subtitle>
-That's crazy.-I know what it is.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:42"><subtitle>
Cabracadabra's going to be huge.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:44"><subtitle>
No one wants to say it out loudbecause we're afraid we'll jinx it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:47"><subtitle>
Yeah. That is exactly what it is.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:50"><subtitle>
Yes. Your stupid businessis gonna be very successful.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:52"><subtitle>
-Yes.-Glad that's out in the open.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:54"><subtitle>
We all know what everyone was thinking,we don't need to askany more questionsor do any wondering about mysteries.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:59"><subtitle>
Nope.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:00"><subtitle>
If you'll excuse me,I need to go watch a sport.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:03"><subtitle>
Great idea.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:04"><subtitle>
The worst part is things have actuallybeen going really well with Todd.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:07"><subtitle>
Our friendship is in a really good place.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:09"><subtitle>
Last week he said,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:10"><subtitle>
"Did you know the wiener dogis neither a wiener nor a dog?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:13"><subtitle>
Instead of saying,"Shut up, Todd," I said, "Okay."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:16"><subtitle>
<description>The Closer</description> So, why did yousleep with Emily?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:18"><subtitle>
Do you think that part of you was gettinguncomfortable with that closeness?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:22"><subtitle>
You felt like you didn't deserveTodd's friendship</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:25"><subtitle>
and you wanted to somehowexternalize that feeling into action?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:29"><subtitle>
No, man, I think I'm just a dumb asshole.Can't it just be that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:33"><subtitle>
When you do bad things,you have something you can point towhen people eventually leave you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:38"><subtitle>
It's not you, you tell yourself,it's that bad thing you did.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:42"><subtitle>
Do you often keep people at arm's length?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:44"><subtitle>
Are you afraid of being knownand knowing others?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:48"><subtitle>
Yeah, you know, I think that you'redefinitely hitting on something realthat I would love to drill down into,but I gotta goto this marketing meeting now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:56"><subtitle>
Which is so annoyingbecause I totally want to keep talkingabout that thing you're talking about.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:01"><subtitle>
But marketing meetings, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:02"><subtitle>
I mean, they're so important.Can I call you back tomorrow?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:05"><subtitle>
-Of course.-Great. Bye.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:10"><subtitle>
-So, how was your marketing meeting?-Weird.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:13"><subtitle>
-Sorry I'm late.-It's fine. We're just getting started.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:15"><subtitle>
I had the worst morning.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:17"><subtitle>
Hanging on every word. Don't tell us.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:18"><subtitle>
So I drove here, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:20"><subtitle>
I'm sitting at the entrance to the garagewhen I realize I don't have my key card.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:24"><subtitle>
I gotta drive all the way home to get it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:26"><subtitle>
When I got there,I couldn't find it anywhere.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:29"><subtitle>
Suddenly, I remember:I put it in the glove compartment.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:32"><subtitle>
It was in my car the entire time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:34"><subtitle>
Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:35"><subtitle>
Because I was driving back and forthso much, I ran out of gas.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:39"><subtitle>
I pulled into a 76.</subtitle>

I was about to pump the gas,I realized I didn't have my credit card,when I rememberedit was on my desk at homebecause I used it to contribute tomy friend's dumb Kickstarter campaign.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:48"><subtitle>
Diane...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:49"><subtitle>
Have you donatedto Virginia's dumb Kickstarter yet?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:52"><subtitle>
-Oh, shit.-Throw her 50 bucks. You can afford it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:55"><subtitle>
Yeah, but I don't like feelinglike I have to, Roxy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:58"><subtitle>
Does the world needa stop-motion short filmabout a pig who goes to circus school?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:02"><subtitle>
Think of it like you're doinga nice thing for your friend.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:05"><subtitle>
Mmm... okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:06"><subtitle>
I called a cab to take me hometo get my credit card.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:09"><subtitle>
Then back to the gas station, get my car,fill it up and come here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:13"><subtitle>
So that's why I'm late.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:15"><subtitle>
-Why did you tell us that whole story?-I don't know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:18"><subtitle>
-Why did you tell me that whole story?-I don't know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:22"><subtitle>
Anyway, I had the ad agency whip upsome options for the new Secretariat ads.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:27"><subtitle>
Good news is the movieis killing out there. Everyone loves it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:30"><subtitle>
If everyone loves it,why do we need a new ad campaign?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:32"><subtitle>
These arethe "For Your Consideration" ads.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:35"><subtitle>
They're a reminder to the Academy,"Have you considered this yet?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:38"><subtitle>
The Academy doesn't alwaysconsider everything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:41"><subtitle>
So they need constantconsideration reminders.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:44"><subtitle>
-That's very considerate.-This one tested the best.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:46"><subtitle>
That's a good one.The rest of these suck.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:48"><subtitle>
Dumb. Dumb. Stupid. Offensive.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:50"><subtitle>
Ugly. Boring. Typical. Stupid.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:53"><subtitle>
Bad. Hideous. Disgusting. Gross. Cliché.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:55"><subtitle>
-I am really good at this.-Huh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:58"><subtitle>
-I kind of like this one.-How'd that piece of crap get in there?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:01"><subtitle>
We ruled that one out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:03"><subtitle>
It's actually really powerful.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:04"><subtitle>
<description>The Closer</description> What spoke to youabout that particular ad?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:07"><subtitle>
<description>BoJack</description> I don't know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:08"><subtitle>
All the pictures of me,they looked backwards.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:11"><subtitle>
When I looked at the mirror ad,I was seeing me as I see myself</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:15"><subtitle>
and I thoughtthere was something beautiful about that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:17"><subtitle>
Intimate, almost.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:19"><subtitle>
Of course you like this ad.When you look at ityou see Secretariat, I see an old turtle.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:23"><subtitle>
"Hello, old turtle. Are you Secretariat?No? You're just some old turtle?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:27"><subtitle>
-What the hell? You've aged terribly."-But you've got the heart of a champion.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:31"><subtitle>
I got a team of cardiologists at Cedarswho say different.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:33"><subtitle>
Isn't that the point of the movie,that anybody could be Secretariat?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:36"><subtitle>
The point of the movie is to makea lot of money and win awards.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:39"><subtitle>
If anyone who looks at this adis Secretariat,why should you win the Oscar?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:43"><subtitle>
He's right, BoJack. Why don't youleave this to the experts, okay?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:49"><subtitle>
-Yes. You're a star.-<description>moaning</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:53"><subtitle>
<description>The Closer</description>So, you also had sex with your publicist?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:56"><subtitle>
<description>BoJack</description> Yeah, couple times.We have a very complicated relationship.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:59"><subtitle>
It's complicated.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:00"><subtitle>
If our relationship was a Meryl Streepmovie, it would be Doubt.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:04"><subtitle>
Don't forget, you have Ellen tomorrow.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:06"><subtitle>
Don't wear that sweater I hate.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:08"><subtitle>
Yes. You're in charge.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:11"><subtitle>
Okay, you know, I gotta sayI don't feel like I'm in charge.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:15"><subtitle>
If you're gonna throw a tantrum,forget the whole thing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:17"><subtitle>
I'm not throwing a tantrum-- Why are wehaving sex in my car?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:20"><subtitle>
-Can we at least go back to your place?-No, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:23"><subtitle>
I don't know where you live.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:24"><subtitle>
You control every part of my life,I don't know anything about you.</subtitle>

I know you and I know what you want.This is exactly what you want.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:40"><subtitle>
<description>The Closer</description>What do you think she meant by that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:42"><subtitle>
Better question:Why am I still getting the L.A. Gazette?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:45"><subtitle>
Do you think getting the paper every dayis a reminder of Todd's papier-mâché head?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:50"><subtitle>
The project he abandonedto make time for the old girlfriend</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:54"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:56"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:00"><subtitle>
No. I want to cancel my subscriptionbecause newspapers are dumb.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:03"><subtitle>
I feel I'm very clear on this point.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:05"><subtitle>
Every morning,someone knocks on my door and says,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:07"><subtitle>
"Throw away this garbage for me."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:09"><subtitle>
So you don't feel any guiltabout your tryst with Emily?</subtitle>

-The worst thing? Or the most recent?-Both.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:30"><subtitle>
Can you keep it down, please?Some people are trying to sleep.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:33"><subtitle>
-We are keeping it down.-We've been really quiet.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:15:35"><subtitle>
-You're basically shouting.-Sorry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:37"><subtitle>
-Do you want me to whisper? Like this?-Yeah, we can be real whispery.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:41"><subtitle>
No, because then I'll hear the"psst, psst, psst."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:44"><subtitle>
And I'll be up all nightwondering what you're talking about.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:46"><subtitle>
-Uh, what would we be talking about?-Yeah, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:49"><subtitle>
What would we be talking about?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:51"><subtitle>

I knew I had to lay low.Go off the grid, disappear.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:47"><subtitle>
<description>The Closer</description>You did what?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:49"><subtitle>
<description>BoJack</description> She lives in thistiny apartment in the Valley.</subtitle>

about watching a person be herself.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:20:02"><subtitle>
<description>BoJack</description> But it wasn't good intimate,like when you see your mom cry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:05"><subtitle>
It was bad intimate,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:06"><subtitle>
like when your dad writes a poemabout Lena Horne's nipples,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:08"><subtitle>
makes you read it out loudso he can hear if it scans.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:11"><subtitle>
<description>The Closer</description> She warned youthat you wouldn't want to know her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:13"><subtitle>
<description>BoJack</description> Yeah. She was right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:14"><subtitle>
It's so sad that when you see someoneas they really are, it ruins them.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:20"><subtitle>
-Do you have someone you can talk to?-About what?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:23"><subtitle>
These feelings you have,your self-destructive behavior.</subtitle>
