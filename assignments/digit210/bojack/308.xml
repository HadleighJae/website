</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:25"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:30"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:04"><subtitle>
Why would Oodles of Moneybe calling collect?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:06"><subtitle>
I don't know. Don't accept the charges,we cannot afford it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:09"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:11"><subtitle>
Okay. But make sureyou're back before, you know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

Deal. Best deal I ever made.<description>kisses</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:17"><subtitle>
Boom!What's black and white and sexy all over?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:21"><subtitle>
Chuff Hollister.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:22"><subtitle>
He's young, he's hot,he's Australian or British or whatever.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:25"><subtitle>
We can paint over his stripesso he looks like a horse.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:27"><subtitle>
I can see the headline now:Chuff Hollister is...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:31"><subtitle>
The next Pegasus.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:32"><subtitle>
BoJack's got star power and gritup the wazoo. I can't imagine...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:35"><subtitle>
Anyone who would appealto the audience more than Chuff.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:39"><subtitle>
He's got sex appeal...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:40"><subtitle>
- Gravitas...- Youth...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:42"><subtitle>
- Experience...- And abs coming out of the wazoo.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:45"><subtitle>
And what a wazoo it is.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:47"><subtitle>
- This would put Gekko-Rabitowitz--- On the map.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:49"><subtitle>
The map of profitable agencies, that is.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:52"><subtitle>
Perfect, because without itwe could be in--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:54"><subtitle>
Real trouble. We did not hitour projected earnings for the year.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:57"><subtitle>
The year's not over yet.We still have one day to go all out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:00"><subtitle>
Rutabaga, do you thinkwe have the spunk and moxie--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:03"><subtitle>
That's a good namefor a lady detective series.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:05"><subtitle>
--required to pull this offand save the agency?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:08"><subtitle>
Hell yeah, I do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:09"><subtitle>
That would be a great titlefor a movie about marrying Satan.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:12"><subtitle>
How are we losing money?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:14"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:03:28"><subtitle>
Ethan Around, the Horsin' Aroundsequel series Brad's trying to get made?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:32"><subtitle>
He called to ask me, I asked him,can you put a bullet in my brain?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:35"><subtitle>
That would probably bea better career move.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:38"><subtitle>
Wait, slow down.Did you say Ethan Around?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:40"><subtitle>
I know.It should be Sabrina Around, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:43"><subtitle>
That's a show people would watch.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:44"><subtitle>
Sabrina doing cool skateboard tricksand eating kettle corn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:48"><subtitle>
Hold on, if this was a real thing,why would Brad call you and not me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:51"><subtitle>
Who knows?Why do people do anything?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:53"><subtitle>
Why did I make the cartoon tree grandmafrom Pocahontas my emergency contact?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:57"><subtitle>
Are you sure this whole thingisn't just a semi-lucid fever dream</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:00"><subtitle>
from mixing the wrong pills?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:01"><subtitle>
Did you not hear?I'm clean and sober, eight months.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:04"><subtitle>
Really? That's incredible.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:06"><subtitle>
Yeah, I wanted a change in my life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:08"><subtitle>
Because I heardif you stop doing drugs for a while,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:11"><subtitle>
the first time you do them again,it's amazing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:14"><subtitle>
-What? No, just stay sober.-Ugh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:16"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:24"><subtitle>
Well, that's troubling.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:25"><subtitle>
Can you believe they're doinga Horsin' Around reboot without me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:28"><subtitle>
What do you care?You're about to be nominated for an Oscar.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:31"><subtitle>
Not the point. This is about respect.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:33"><subtitle>
BoJack, is this really a good idea?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:35"><subtitle>
<description>phone rings</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:36"><subtitle>
Tools. Brad speaking.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:38"><subtitle>
You're doing a new showin the extended Horsin' Around</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:40"><subtitle>
cinematic universe and you didn't call me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:42"><subtitle>
Hey, BoJack.Ethan Around is just an idea I had.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:46"><subtitle>
It's not officially happening or anything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:47"><subtitle>
I would love for you to be part of it,but the horse died in the series finale.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:52"><subtitle>
So? We could write around that.The Horse dying was just a dream.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:55"><subtitle>
The Horse had a twin brother,comes back as a ghost.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:58"><subtitle>
Ethan missed the Horse so muchhe built a robot Horse as a tribute.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:01"><subtitle>
"I've heard of overloaded motherboards,but this is ridiculous."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:05"><subtitle>
Those are off the top of my head,they're all gold.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:08"><subtitle>
I'm surprised you're so into the idea.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:09"><subtitle>
I've been having troublegetting networks on the phone,but with a big star like you attached,we could sell this right away.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:15"><subtitle>
I wouldn't say I'm attached...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:17"><subtitle>
Don't move.I'm getting the next flight down to LA.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:20"><subtitle>
- Right now?- And purchased.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:22"><subtitle>
BoJack, for the last 20 years</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:24"><subtitle>
I've been telling peopleI didn't need the trappings of fame,that I was better off,happy with my little B-plus lifeat my little B-plus hardware storein little B-plus Olympia, Washington.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:34"><subtitle>
B-minus children. But it's a lie.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:36"><subtitle>
I miss the warmth of the spotlighton my face.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:39"><subtitle>
The thrill of telling a jokeand feeling it land.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:41"><subtitle>
Is that a thrill you experienced?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:43"><subtitle>
The sitcom stage is my home,and I'm tired of denying myself that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:48"><subtitle>
I'm ready to come home.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:50"><subtitle>
Great.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:52"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:58"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:01"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:05"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:07"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:27"><subtitle>
I'm loving that segue, Todd.You are a conversational Magellan.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:31"><subtitle>
Turns out there's a huge demandfor a safe space for women. Who knew?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:35"><subtitle>
Honestly, never would've crossed my mind.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:37"><subtitle>
So I was thinking, what's the next step?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:40"><subtitle>
What if we made our safe spacefor women...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:43"><subtitle>
<description>crashes</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:45"><subtitle>
...also available to men?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:47"><subtitle>
That's an untapped market.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:49"><subtitle>
All right, then it's agreed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:50"><subtitle>
No goodbye?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:52"><subtitle>
He's a conversational Amelia Earhart.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:54"><subtitle>
Mr. Peanutbutter andCaptain Peanutbutter in the same room?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:59"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:07:29"><subtitle>
- <description>growls</description>- <description>Diane</description> Oh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:34"><subtitle>
So David Pincher is about to shootthe Flight of the Pegasus trilogyin New Zealand,and BoJack is perfect for the lead.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:41"><subtitle>
A part like that would really underlinethat BoJack's more than just an actor,he's a movie star.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:47"><subtitle>
If I'm doing that,I conveniently won't be ableto do that dumbassEthan Around show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:51"><subtitle>
Use that when you tell him I won't do it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:53"><subtitle>
Why don't you tell himyou don't want to do it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:54"><subtitle>
I can't. I'm like a father figure to him--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:57"><subtitle>
I slept with his mother.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:58"><subtitle>
- Gross.- No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:59"><subtitle>
I slept with her 20 years ago.She was young then, not gross.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:02"><subtitle>
Ugh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:03"><subtitle>
Hey, loved you inThe Caveman's Valentine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:06"><subtitle>
- Hmm?- Nothing? The Caveman's Valentine?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:08"><subtitle>
Samuel L. Jackson had that big beard?Look it up.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:11"><subtitle>
- When you start laughing, call me.- Will do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:13"><subtitle>
Do we have an offeron the Pegasus movie?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:15"><subtitle>
I'll get it, Kalamata.Don't get your pita in a wad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:17"><subtitle>
Wow. Flight of the Pegasus.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:19"><subtitle>
This must bewhat Robert Downey Jr. felt likewhen he woke up on thatstranger's bathroom floorand found out he was gonna be Iron Man.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:27"><subtitle>
<description>man on radio</description> It's another unseasonablywarm day in the Labrador Peninsula</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:32"><subtitle>
and things are looking sunnyall the way to the new year.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:34"><subtitle>
It really is true what they say...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:36"><subtitle>
<description>both</description> Nothing bad ever happenson the Labrador Peninsula.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:38"><subtitle>
Oh, paradise.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:45"><subtitle>
<description>children laugh</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:56"><subtitle>
Uncle Mister. Uncle Mister.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:58"><subtitle>
Now who let these little monstersonto my peninsula?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:01"><subtitle>
We're your nephews.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:03"><subtitle>
What? I don't remember my nephewsbeing made out of candy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:07"><subtitle>
- Gobble, gobble, gobble.- <description>all laugh</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:10"><subtitle>
Look at those children.Little miracles, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:14"><subtitle>
They're adorable, not thatI value them based on their looks.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:18"><subtitle>
Because, of course,children in society todayare often reduced to their cuteness.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:22"><subtitle>
I can't wait to getto know your children as people,so I can specificallycompliment them individuallyon the foundation of their characters.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:30"><subtitle>
Well, one day they'll die, just like us.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:33"><subtitle>
Uh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:34"><subtitle>
- Do you believe in the soul?- What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:36"><subtitle>
Life is the most precious resourcewe have. Remember that, Diane.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:41"><subtitle>
Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:44"><subtitle>
<description>laughs</description> Pretty great, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:46"><subtitle>
Did you tell your brotherabout the A-B-O-R-T-I-O-N?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:51"><subtitle>
The audition?No, I could never tell him about that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:53"><subtitle>
He thinks I'm offer-only,it would break his heart.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:56"><subtitle>
Wait, what audition?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:57"><subtitle>
- No, the abortion.- Oh, no. Should I have?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:00"><subtitle>
He said some weird stuff to me earlier.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:03"><subtitle>
The kind of stuff you'd hearin a sad Creed song.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:05"><subtitle>
Or a happy Elliott Smith song.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:07"><subtitle>
Oh, he's probably just razzing ya,but he's a good dog. All bark, no bite.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:11"><subtitle>
Sorry, that's a Labrador expression.I guess in human terms it would be:</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:15"><subtitle>
He's all talk, and no shooting youwith an assault rifle.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:19"><subtitle>
Is that what you think humans do?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:21"><subtitle>
Am I wrong?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:24"><subtitle>
<description>Rutabaga</description> Boom! This is David Pincher.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:27"><subtitle>
And this is everyone who works for him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:30"><subtitle>
Now unfortunately for us,everyone on this boardmust really like their boss's movies,because for the holidays,they're all Gone Girl.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:38"><subtitle>
Thank you, except for her. Boom.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:41"><subtitle>
The assistant to David Pincher'scasting director.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:45"><subtitle>
Wait a second, I know that face.Why does she look so familiar?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:49"><subtitle>
- Oh, fish.- Oh, fish.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:51"><subtitle>
So when I found outthat the best assistant I ever hadwas working for David Pincher,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:56"><subtitle>
I mean, what are the odds?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:57"><subtitle>
Did he hire you because of your cutelittle Benjamin Button-nose?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:01"><subtitle>
I'll put in a good word for BoJack,but I'm just an assistant.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:04"><subtitle>
Just an assistant?Laura, assistants are everything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:08"><subtitle>
You're the first people in,the last people out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:10"><subtitle>
You know everyone's real name, age,nose, teeth, and tits.</subtitle>

You have power, because in today's economythe only true power is information.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:17"><subtitle>
I want you to use that power.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:19"><subtitle>
I want you to get your bossto pick BoJack as his Pegasus.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:22"><subtitle>
I always believed in you, Laura.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:25"><subtitle>
The question is:do you believe in yourself?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:27"><subtitle>
Wow, that's--I'm sorry, did you just make that up?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:30"><subtitle>
Because that was--Is that a speech you had ready to go?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:33"><subtitle>
- Will you do this for me?- Of course.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:35"><subtitle>
You went to bat for me when I triedto get a promotion at Vigor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:38"><subtitle>
I pushed so hard for you.I did everything I could.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:41"><subtitle>
I mean, we gals gotta look outfor each other. Right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:51"><subtitle>
So you're talking about a merger?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:52"><subtitle>
Since my dad croakedI've been running Vigor myself,and I've been doing a pretty good job,A-minus/B-plus.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:59"><subtitle>
But I could use a few more experiencedhands to help guide the ship,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:03"><subtitle>
- because being a boss is really hard.- Yes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:07"><subtitle>
Princess Carolyn can be a proud woman.I'm glad you came to me first.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:10"><subtitle>
I would have gone to her directly,but sometimes she yells at meand I do not like being yelled atand that is just something that peopleneed to understand about me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:18"><subtitle>
I'll talk to her, when the time is right.</subtitle>

So on the new show Ethan is the dad,and he's raising three little horses.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:30"><subtitle>
You couldn't have told methis over the phone?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:32"><subtitle>
This show is going to change my life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:34"><subtitle>
I'm taking the kids out of schooland moving everyone down here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:37"><subtitle>
I just had an offer acceptedon a house in Sherman Oaks.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:40"><subtitle>
As long as I don't change my mindbefore the new year, boom.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:43"><subtitle>
Two million dollars, gone.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:44"><subtitle>
- The new year? That's tonight.- I know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:46"><subtitle>
Did you talk to my agentby any chance?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:48"><subtitle>
- No.- She didn't call you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:49"><subtitle>
I talked to her, and I don't knowif she wants me to do it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:53"><subtitle>
You know how agents are.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:54"><subtitle>
Just remember,I'm not the bad guy here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:56"><subtitle>
I hear you loud and clear.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:58"><subtitle>
Don't worry.We won't take no for an answer.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:00"><subtitle>
I think my schedule's gonna be tough--Might be going to New Zealand.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:03"><subtitle>
We'll work around your schedule.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:05"><subtitle>
Those bastards got my quoteso damn high.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:07"><subtitle>
We'll pay it.No obstacle is insurmountable.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:09"><subtitle>
- As long as you want to do it.- And I do want to do it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:13"><subtitle>
Get me out of this thing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:14"><subtitle>
This asshole's giving me everythingI ask for. What a nightmare.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:17"><subtitle>
- Tell him you don't want to do the show.- I can't. It would destroy him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:20"><subtitle>
Destroying people is what I pay you to do,so I don't think about the peopleI'm destroying.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:25"><subtitle>
Do you not know what an agent is?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:27"><subtitle>
- <description>knocking</description>- <description>Ethan</description> BoJack, are you okay in there?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:30"><subtitle>
Is it number one or number two?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:35"><subtitle>
That cat's running circles around us.What are we going to do?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:38"><subtitle>
Maybe we can distract her?I'm thinking laser pointer.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:41"><subtitle>
If we're going to beat her,we need to think like her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:45"><subtitle>
Instead of convincing the Pegasuspeople they don't want BoJack,what if we convince BoJackhe doesn't want Pegasus?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:51"><subtitle>
Fantastic. How do we do that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:53"><subtitle>
Kelsey.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:55"><subtitle>
Kelsey? That's what I said whenthey said you wanted to meet with me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:58"><subtitle>
I figured you never wantedto see me again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:00"><subtitle>
I never want to see anyone again,but there's a book I've been tryingto turn into a movie and I need your help.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:05"><subtitle>
It's a coming-of-age storyabout a girl who likes jellybeans.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:09"><subtitle>
The option expires tonight at midnight,unless I can find a big enough starto secure funding.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:14"><subtitle>
Frankly, I already gave up on it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:15"><subtitle>
Then my agent said,"Maybe BoJack's interested."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:18"><subtitle>
So the reasonyou think I'm right for the roleis because I'm a big enough starto secure funding?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:22"><subtitle>
Don't get smart, BoJack.You're not good at it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:25"><subtitle>
You're really giving the hard sell here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:26"><subtitle>
I hear they've got you locked into some fantasy dystopia thing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:30"><subtitle>
Are you just gonna do stupid bullshitfor the rest of your life?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:33"><subtitle>
For work or, like, in general?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:34"><subtitle>
I saw something in you,something most people don't know you have,and it kills me that insteadof sharing it with the world,you want to hide it under somewonderland unicorn nonsense.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:43"><subtitle>
It's a Pegasus. Unicorns are for babies.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:46"><subtitle>
The movie I want to makeisn't glamorous or sexy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:48"><subtitle>
You don't get to be the big heroeverybody loves.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:50"><subtitle>
You get to be a guywho works at a gas station,who gets in a fight with his daughterabout jellybeans.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:55"><subtitle>
That's the whole movie.It's small and it's real.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:58"><subtitle>
And you'd get to workwith a director who sees you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:01"><subtitle>
And I can't sell it any better than that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:04"><subtitle>
You're right, that one scenewe shot that didn't even make itinto the Secretariat moviewas the best thing I ever did.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:10"><subtitle>
Why am I wasting my timewith this other stuff?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:12"><subtitle>
- So you're in?- Let's do it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:14"><subtitle>
Great. How's your little friendwith the face?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:16"><subtitle>
Is he up to his old tricks,getting into scrapes?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:19"><subtitle>
<description>laughs</description> What a little scamp.Will you tell him I said hi?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:26"><subtitle>
Kelsey's movie sounds perfect.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:28"><subtitle>
Is it the nobody's-gonna-see-it elementor the fact you'll be working for peanuts?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:32"><subtitle>
This jellybean thing could show the worldthat BoJack's more than just a movie star.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:36"><subtitle>
- He's an actor.- Yeah, well, that's great,but I've been working all dayon getting him the Pegasus movieyou said would show the worldhe's a movie star.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:43"><subtitle>
I don't want that anymore.I want to do something real.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:46"><subtitle>
You realize how much moneywe'd be walking away from?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:49"><subtitle>
This isn't about money.Doesn't matter to me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:50"><subtitle>
- Yeah, it doesn't matter to you.- Right. So what's the problem?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:53"><subtitle>
Maybe you can find a wayfor BoJack to do both?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:56"><subtitle>
You're supposed to bethis amazing agent, after all.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:59"><subtitle>
I'll see what I can do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:04"><subtitle>
New beers for the new year's?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:07"><subtitle>
We got a regularMaya Angelou over here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:10"><subtitle>
Good times.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:12"><subtitle>
- <description>cell phone rings</description>-- Oh, it's Todd. Gotta take this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:14"><subtitle>
- Maybe you can call him back later?- Todd!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:17"><subtitle>
Don't be too long,or I'm gonna drink all your beer.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:20"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description>Diane, do you ever look up at the starsand feel likethey're tiny holes in the sky,sucking out all the oxygen,and suddenly you can't breathebecause you're thinking about how smallyou are and how meaningless it all is?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:34"><subtitle>
Uh... I guess.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:37"><subtitle>
It's so cruel to let people love you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:39"><subtitle>
All you're doing is promisingyou'll one day break their hearts.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:44"><subtitle>
Cool fire pit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:47"><subtitle>
So it turns out men love safe spacesfor women even more than women do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:53"><subtitle>
You gotta read some of these comments.Queefburglar69 says:</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:57"><subtitle>
"These sexy lady chauffeursalways get me where I need to go."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:01"><subtitle>
That's unambiguous.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:03"><subtitle>
The only problem is some of the drivershave been complainingabout the new customer base.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:08"><subtitle>
The workers are allowed to complain?We gotta tighten up that ship.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:12"><subtitle>
Most of the new passengersare perfect gentlemen,but we've found that a growing numberare rating our driversnot on performance but on "bangability",which creates an unfair advantagefor our "bangable" driversand creates what someof our more homely employeeshave dubbed a hostile sexy-ocracy.Whoa!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:34"><subtitle>
Well, our first priority is creatinga safe space for women,so if our womendon't feel safe in that space,we should replace themwith women who do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:42"><subtitle>
Where can we find women who arecomfortable around gentlemen?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:48"><subtitle>
I know. A gentleman's club.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:50"><subtitle>
That's perfect.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:51"><subtitle>
To Whale World.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:55"><subtitle>
Well, you didn't hear it from me,but I pulled some strings and you're in.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:59"><subtitle>
I always knew you were a superstar.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:01"><subtitle>
Let's get drinks in the new yearand work out the deets--That's a fast way of saying detailsfor people who don't have timefor every detail of the word details.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:08"><subtitle>
Vanessa Gekko on line two.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:09"><subtitle>
Great, put that raggedy-ass bitch on.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:11"><subtitle>
I'm gonna bat her aroundlike a ball of foil.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:14"><subtitle>
I know you're excited, but we are stillin a very precarious position,and I wonder if foil-ball-battingis the best tack here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:21"><subtitle>
Judah, this is where I live.Watch and learn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:24"><subtitle>
Hey, we heard BoJack and Kelseyhad a great meeting on Jelly Belle.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:28"><subtitle>
Gotta tie this up tonightif it's going to happen.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:30"><subtitle>
BoJack would love to do the movie,but you're gonna have to workaround his Pegasus schedule.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:35"><subtitle>
Oh, um... That might be tricky.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:37"><subtitle>
Then you're gonna have to matchhis Pegasus quote.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:40"><subtitle>
- He won't do it for a penny less.- Princess Carolyn--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:43"><subtitle>
Even with a star like BoJack,Kelsey can't get that kind of money.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:46"><subtitle>
Well, then, work around his schedule.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:48"><subtitle>
You're overplaying your hand, PC,and I'm calling your bluff.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:51"><subtitle>
I'm barreling towards you fast, Gekko,and this Mack truck ain't gonna blink.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:55"><subtitle>
That's not fair. I was clearlyestablishing a poker metaphor,you just changed it to a game of chicken.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:00"><subtitle>
My court. My rules.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:01"><subtitle>
Court? What game are you playing?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:03"><subtitle>
Bye.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:05"><subtitle>
- Damn it!- Question:</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:06"><subtitle>
Am I the faulty bike tire pumpI had in seventh grade?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:10"><subtitle>
Because I just blew this thing wide open.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:12"><subtitle>
- Talk to me, soldier.- I have been scouring old emails.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:15"><subtitle>
I didn't know what I was looking for.I knew there was something.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:18"><subtitle>
And I found it. Bam!</subtitle>

It's the Cabracadabra New Year's party.These are our drivers.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:46"><subtitle>
Oh. Uh, where's Emily?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:48"><subtitle>
She left.She said she didn't feel comfortable here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:51"><subtitle>
She certainly didn't feel comfortablepaying for the food she ate.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:55"><subtitle>
Yeah, okay, BoJack.</subtitle>

I got champagne for my real friends,'cause that's what you are.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:03"><subtitle>
- A real friend.- He doesn't want to do your show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:06"><subtitle>
- What?- BoJack is about to win an Oscar.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:08"><subtitle>
Why do you think he would wantto do your soon-to-fail sitcomabout the further adventuresof a carb-faced nobody?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:13"><subtitle>
- Oh, maybe--- You are not a television star.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:16"><subtitle>
You have no talent and I am forgettingyour face even as I'm looking at it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:20"><subtitle>
Pack your bags.Go back to Nowheresville.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:22"><subtitle>
Thank you for the champagne.Best regards, Ana Spanakopita.</subtitle>

Oh, God, the house!I gotta pull my deposit! Pick up--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:32"><subtitle>
Oh, no. I dropped my phone in a bog.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:37"><subtitle>
Something is going on with your brother.You need to talk to him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:40"><subtitle>
We don't really have the kind ofrelationship where we talk about things.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:43"><subtitle>
Labs prefer to keep things playful.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:45"><subtitle>
You know what they say about dogs?Talking to each other is rrruff.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:49"><subtitle>
I'm serious, Mr. Peanutbutter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:50"><subtitle>
And I'm serious that you should drop it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:53"><subtitle>
If something was really wrong,he would tell me about it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:56"><subtitle>
Would he?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:57"><subtitle>
I know he's your brother,but he's hiding something from you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:59"><subtitle>
Why do you think you know my brotherbetter than I do?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:02"><subtitle>
Just because you have a shittyrelationship with your familydoesn't mean every other familyhas to have drama too.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:07"><subtitle>
I wanted to come up hereand have a nice time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:09"><subtitle>
This place is an escape for me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:11"><subtitle>
- Okay, I'm sorry, I just--- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:14"><subtitle>
I should not have shouted at you.I just...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:16"><subtitle>
I need to go for a walk.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:23"><subtitle>
- Oh, hey.- Hey, is there something going on?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:27"><subtitle>
Because I know there isn't,but if there is, you would tell me, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:31"><subtitle>
But there's nothing to tell,because nothing bad ever happenson the Labrador Peninsula.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:35"><subtitle>
- Okay, I think you should sit down.- Why?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:38"><subtitle>
- I need to talk to you. Sit down.- I will not sit down.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:41"><subtitle>
- Mr. Peanutbutter, sit.- Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:44"><subtitle>
- I got a twisted spleen.- No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:47"><subtitle>
It's not fatal, necessarily.Everything's gonna be fine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:50"><subtitle>
They still have to run some tests.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:52"><subtitle>
- But it's going to be fine?- Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:54"><subtitle>
Promise me it's going to be fine?You're my big brother.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:56"><subtitle>
That means you can't lie to me about this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:58"><subtitle>
Mr. Peanutbutter, you are the bestrunt of the litter a guy could ask for.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:03"><subtitle>
No, don't do this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:04"><subtitle>
- But there might come a time...- Please.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:06"><subtitle>
