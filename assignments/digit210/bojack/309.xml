<timestamp time="00:00:22"><subtitle>
BoJack! Beautiful day, huh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:24"><subtitle>
Perfect day to go outside,not read the tradesor talk to anyone in the industryor watch entertainment televisionor have a gut feeling about the ratingsfor your television show last night.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:33"><subtitle>
- Princess Carolyn, I'm dying.- You read the trades.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:36"><subtitle>
My heart is in my stomach,my stomach is in my butt,and my butt ran away with the spoon.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:41"><subtitle>
That makes sensebecause your butt is quite a dish.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:44"><subtitle>
Can you come over? I need you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:46"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:50"><subtitle>
What the...?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:52"><subtitle>
I ordered a few feel better pizzasto feel better. It did not work.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:56"><subtitle>
Then I sprinkled happy pills on them,and washed it all downwith a "Please, God, make my pain go away"vermouth and ice cream float.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:03"><subtitle>
- Somehow I feel worse.- That's a real mystery.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:05"><subtitle>
My show was terrible.Why did I insist on a mockumentary format?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:09"><subtitle>
It's already an overused trope now,in 2007.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:12"><subtitle>
Mockumentary is not a trope,it's a device for storytelling.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:16"><subtitle>
And your show is daring and cutting edge.People just aren't ready.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:19"><subtitle>
Yeah, people! It's not me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:22"><subtitle>
It's the people that are the problem!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:24"><subtitle>
Everyone's dumb and I am great.Why do I always forget that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:27"><subtitle>
That's the spirit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:28"><subtitle>
I'm starting to think this show isthe best thing that happened to me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:31"><subtitle>
- Really?- Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:32"><subtitle>
It made me realize you're the best thingthat happened to me,with your sexy cat eyesand your cute little hair curl.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:38"><subtitle>
You look like a soft servestrawberry ice cream.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:42"><subtitle>
BoJack, we can't. I'm your agent.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:44"><subtitle>
You are so much more than that.You're my lighthouse, my Garmin.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:48"><subtitle>
You're the little plastic tablethey put in pizza boxesto keep the pizza from getting smushed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:52"><subtitle>
You're Princess Carolyn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:02"><subtitle>
- What?- What? Nothing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:04"><subtitle>
- Did you just say something to me?- No, I was just being wistful, I guess.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:07"><subtitle>
Well, can you be wistful a little quieter?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:10"><subtitle>
- Not everyone is interested in your wist.- Okay, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:16"><subtitle>
- You smell nice.- Thanks, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:22"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:23"><subtitle>
Okay, gotta go. I'm about to meetmy most important client.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:26"><subtitle>
- I know you're not really on the phone.- Bye, Mr. President.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:29"><subtitle>
Give my love to your basketball friends.You too.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:33"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:03:48"><subtitle>
You think Halle Berrywould've been offered Catwoman</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:52"><subtitle>

</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:11"><subtitle>
- You mean sweating bullets?- I don't think so.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:13"><subtitle>
Sweating bullets.How does that make the sense?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:16"><subtitle>
How does sweating bull's netsmake sense?</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:04:18"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:05:26"><subtitle>
What can I say? Sometimes I'm too goodof an agent, so deals fall apart.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:12:04"><subtitle>
And the critic is growing very impatient.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:07"><subtitle>
Writing that down...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:10"><subtitle>
- Just do what you normally do.- But there's no chef.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:43"><subtitle>
- Know what I think?- Don't wanna hear it.</subtitle>

So this isn't about me being a bad agent.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:04"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:06"><subtitle>
A sex-mommy who keeps her boundaries,is that too much to ask?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:09"><subtitle>
Is there a single womanyou've worked withwho you haven't triedto groggily thrust yourself into?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:14"><subtitle>

All you do is tell meI'm a terrible person.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:20"><subtitle>
Please, you're sucha self-pitying masochist,</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:15:23"><subtitle>

Does self-pitying masochist count,or are we starting from scratch?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:35"><subtitle>
Okay, one-- I'm freezing my whiskers off.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:38"><subtitle>
- You have a natural charisma.- You hesitated, that means it's a lie.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

<timestamp time="00:15:43"><subtitle>
That's not a compliment.So is Kim Jong Un and Teri Hatcher.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:46"><subtitle>
I got this. I got this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:48"><subtitle>
Pre-heat oven?Where's the pre-heat button?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:50"><subtitle>
Excuse me? Waiter?</subtitle>

So I'm a clown to you?Like Joe Pesci in Home Alone?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:19"><subtitle>
<description>laughs</description> You recognizeyou're being impossible, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:21"><subtitle>
- I don't know how you put up with me.- I didn't put up with you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:26"><subtitle>
I liked being with you.And I don't regret it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:30"><subtitle>
I don't regret the trip to the Bahamas.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:32"><subtitle>
Or the bracelet you bought mefor my 38th birthday.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:35"><subtitle>
Or when my dad diedand you came to the funeralwith me and held my hand.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:39"><subtitle>
I'm doing this for both of us.You understand?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:42"><subtitle>
- Did you ever love me? At all?- I don't-- I'm not--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:46"><subtitle>
You know that I don't dothe whole love thing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:50"><subtitle>
Either you end up hurting someoneor they hurt you. So, what's the point?</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:02"><subtitle>
- Why do I do this to myself?- I don't know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:04"><subtitle>
Maybe if you're good at putting out fires,you just run from fire to fireand don't really think about--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:08"><subtitle>
<description>screams</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:09"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:22"><subtitle>
This night has been a disaster.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:24"><subtitle>
The good news is I got my kidto prep my important meeting at work.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:27"><subtitle>
The bad news isall the customers went home.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:30"><subtitle>
They didn't like the screamingand felt like their foodwas a little too "on fire".</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:34"><subtitle>
- It's called a char, dumbshits.- The critic's still here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:37"><subtitle>
Oh, oh, oh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:39"><subtitle>
She still wants her mushroom risotto.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:43"><subtitle>
I don't know how to make risotto.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:45"><subtitle>
I know how.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:46"><subtitle>
What are you doing? No, go home.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:48"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:18"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:22"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:29"><subtitle>
Goddamn it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:31"><subtitle>
How should I know?Do I look like an expert in cooking oils?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:34"><subtitle>
We have to choose!We're running out of time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:37"><subtitle>
- Olive. You wanna use olive oil.- What are you doing?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:40"><subtitle>
Let me do this.You'll burn the place to the ground.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:42"><subtitle>
Fine. This isn't one of those thingswhere you save my assso I feel obligated to give youyour job back.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:48"><subtitle>
I know you have no senseof obligation to me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:51"><subtitle>
Ooh, slam. I'm sorry,I'd rather not get involved.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:55"><subtitle>
Can I get you some more water?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:57"><subtitle>
You look lovely. It's a great blouse.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:59"><subtitle>
Mom, I wanna go home.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:01"><subtitle>
This is a very important nightfor the restaurant.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:03"><subtitle>
How are we coming on the sales meeting?Did you get the big conference room?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:07"><subtitle>
Winslow wants the big conference roomfor his presentation to corporate.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:11"><subtitle>
You get back on that phoneand you get me that big room.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:14"><subtitle>
Okay, Mom.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:17"><subtitle>
The secret is stirring continuously.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:19"><subtitle>
Right, so that's the secret.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:22"><subtitle>
I'm gonna go roll some more soy balls.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:26"><subtitle>
- Thanks for your help.- Sure.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:28"><subtitle>
How do you know how to do this?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:30"><subtitle>
Mom was a live-in maid for a rich family.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:32"><subtitle>
She had a little troublebending her elbow too much.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:35"><subtitle>
Unless I wanted us to be on the street,I had to cover for her, a lot.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:40"><subtitle>
That rich family loved Italian foodand champagne fountains.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:43"><subtitle>
And cocaine. And private jets.And screaming at each other.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:47"><subtitle>
"Who threw my cocainein the champagne fountain?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:49"><subtitle>
- So standard rich people stuff?- I guess.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:53"><subtitle>
- How come you never told me that?- I did.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:56"><subtitle>
It's okay. I knowyou never remember anything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:58"><subtitle>
That's not true.I remember the first time we met.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:01"><subtitle>
I went to see Marv. You wereat the desk in front of his office.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:05"><subtitle>
I thought you were cute and you said,"It's good to see you again."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:10"><subtitle>
- So I guess we'd met before.- That was the third time we met.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:13"><subtitle>
The first time was when I was an intern.I delivered a script to your house.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:18"><subtitle>
You were passed out in the yard,covered in tapioca pudding.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:21"><subtitle>
I hosed you down, dragged you inside,covered you with a blanket.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:24"><subtitle>
- Really? I don't remember that.- Shocker.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:26"><subtitle>
So you've gone from daughter of a maidto head of your own company.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:30"><subtitle>
The company's not doing so hot.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:32"><subtitle>
- Don't try to guilt me.- It's not your fault.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:34"><subtitle>
Turns out being an agent and runningan agency are two different skills.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:38"><subtitle>
It's like asking a really delicious tomatoto make you a tomato sandwich.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:41"><subtitle>
How's a tomato gonna make youa sandwich? He's got no arms.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:44"><subtitle>
You'll figure it out. Princess Carolynalways lands on her feet.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:47"><subtitle>
But I don't even know why I'm doing it.Does any of it matter?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:50"><subtitle>
Why are you an agent at allif it makes you so miserable?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:54"><subtitle>
Because I'm good at it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:55"><subtitle>
I mean, stuff hasn't been hitting lately.But, usually, I'm really good at it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:59"><subtitle>
Just 'cause you're good at somethingdoesn't mean you have to do it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:01"><subtitle>
I'm good at driving sober,but I don't relish the opportunity.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:04"><subtitle>
But what else would I do?Who else would I be?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:09"><subtitle>
I do love you, by the way.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:11"><subtitle>
I mean, as muchas I'm capable of loving anyone.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:15"><subtitle>
Which is never enough. I'm sorry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:23"><subtitle>
Ta-da!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:27"><subtitle>
Well, it is truly...how should I put this? Wonderful.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:37"><subtitle>
So you'll give Elefante a good review?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:39"><subtitle>
No, I can't do that.I waited over two hours to be served.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:44"><subtitle>
The ambience was terrible.You two were screaming all night.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:48"><subtitle>
At one point, a waiterran through the restaurant on fire.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:51"><subtitle>
Unfortunately,you will be receiving my lowest rating:four hundred and twelve stars,out of a possible a billion.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:59"><subtitle>
A billion stars?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:00"><subtitle>
Yes, that's the rubric I use onSamanthaGoesToRestaurants.tumblr.com.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:04"><subtitle>
Oh, God, get out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:06"><subtitle>
I assure you the animated GIFswith which I describe this encountershall be scathing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:13"><subtitle>

</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:33"><subtitle>
- How about a drink?- I could drink.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:34"><subtitle>
I don't think I can. I'm heading out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:36"><subtitle>
I got pretty badly burnt earlierand in a lot of pain.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:39"><subtitle>
I should probably go to the ER.Have a great night.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:42"><subtitle>
<description>groans</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:48"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:50"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:53"><subtitle>
The one where Olivia put too muchdetergent in the washing machine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:57"><subtitle>
Oh, yeah.Nancy Reagan was the guest star.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:59"><subtitle>
That womanwas the real actor in the family.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
