<description>funky electronic music</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:28"><subtitle>
<music>â™ª</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:20"><subtitle>
It happened again. Why do I keepthinking things will make me happy?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:24"><subtitle>
-What is wrong with me?-BoJack, don't do this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:26"><subtitle>
-Don't fetishize your own sadness.-Uh... Oh, God, I'm drowning.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:31"><subtitle>
-I feel like I'm drowning.-BoJack, listen.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:34"><subtitle>
When I was 17,I snuck out to a fraternity party.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:38"><subtitle>
The roads were icyand I swerved into the lake.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:44"><subtitle>
I came to underwater.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:46"><subtitle>
It was dark and cold,and I didn't even know which way was up.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:50"><subtitle>
I thought for sure I was going to drown.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:54"><subtitle>
And then... I noticed...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:58"><subtitle>
when I opened my mouth,the air bubbles floated up,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:02"><subtitle>
and that's how I knewwhich way to swim.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:06"><subtitle>
That is a terrifying story.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:07"><subtitle>
BoJack, when you find yourself lostand disoriented and underwaterand you don't know which way is up,it's important to breathe.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:16"><subtitle>
I don't deserve this.I'm not a best actor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:19"><subtitle>
Awards aren't about who's best, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:21"><subtitle>
That's literally the only thingthey're about.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:23"><subtitle>
No. All this means is thatyou're one of the special people.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:26"><subtitle>
I saw it the first time I met you.You must have known it all your life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:30"><subtitle>
And all your life, people told youthat you were wrong,that you weren't special,that you were just like everybody else.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:37"><subtitle>
But now, the special people are saying,"You were right, BoJack. You were right."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:42"><subtitle>
I was right.I am one of the special people.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

<timestamp time="00:05:01"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:05:05"><subtitle>
But I actually just camebecause I heard about the nominationand I wanted to make sure you're okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:09"><subtitle>
That's a funny wayof saying congratulations.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:11"><subtitle>
But not funny "ha-ha",more like funny Doonesbury.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:14"><subtitle>
I know how this kind of thingcan sometimes send you spinning.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:16"><subtitle>
"Oh, God, why doesn't this make me happy?Will anything make me happy?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:19"><subtitle>
I'm an empty husk." That kind of thing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:21"><subtitle>
Well, thank you for that,but I'm actually doing great.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:24"><subtitle>
I direct your attention tothe aforementioned chili cheese fountain!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:29"><subtitle>
It's too bad I'm not managingyour social campaign anymore,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:32"><subtitle>
because this party would makea great Snapchat story.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:34"><subtitle>
You are not gonna make me guiltyabout leaving Princess Carolyn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:37"><subtitle>
I'm not here to make you feel guilty.Like I said--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:39"><subtitle>
Honestly, I don't even knowwhat you're doing over there.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:41"><subtitle>
-Tweeting for celebrities?-Well, actually, I don't--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:44"><subtitle>
When I met you, you wereso cool and interesting--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:46"><subtitle>
Uh, I was never cool.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:47"><subtitle>
You used to actually care about shit.What happened?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:49"><subtitle>
I don't know, BoJack.Maybe caring about shit got old.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:52"><subtitle>
Maybe I'm tired of everyone yelling at meand sending death threats to my house,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:56"><subtitle>
and all my friends thinking I'm annoying,and getting in fights with my husband,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:59"><subtitle>
and seeing little refugee boysdie in hospital bombings.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:03"><subtitle>
It's exhausting and I can't do it.If that makes me a bad person,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:06"><subtitle>
then I'm sorry that I'm notthe "cool, interesting girl."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:08"><subtitle>
I never said you were a bad person.I just said it's not you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

-Tes-ley.-You're just looking at the Tesla.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:06:20"><subtitle>
I don't know why it's so hard for youto believe that I could be happy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:22"><subtitle>
I'm not like you, okay?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:23"><subtitle>
-I don't fetishize my own sadness.-I don't fetishize my own sadness.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:29"><subtitle>

Raven on a wire.A gloomy portent, precariously perched.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:49"><subtitle>
And, as the sun sets,so does it spread its deathly shadowacross the just and unjustof the outdoor seating areaof the California Pizza Kitchen.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:00"><subtitle>
Mm-hmm! And what better wayto view such disquieting omensthan through these gorgeousfloor-to-ceiling windows?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:06"><subtitle>
Yeah. Wow! They really makeregular windows look like shit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:10"><subtitle>
I can't look out the windowwhile lying on the floor?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:13"><subtitle>
-No, thank you, regular window!-Tell me a little about your company.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:17"><subtitle>
Well, it started as a safe spacefor women.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:20"><subtitle>
Ooh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:21"><subtitle>
Then, it became a safe spacefor women and men.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:24"><subtitle>
Oh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:25"><subtitle>
Now, it's moreof a safe-ish space for women...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:28"><subtitle>
Mm-hmm.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:29"><subtitle>
...and a really safe spacefor men to look at women...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:32"><subtitle>
I hear you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:33"><subtitle>
...while also being driven around by them.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:35"><subtitle>
-Wow! Something for everyone.-Demand is skyrocketing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:39"><subtitle>
That's why we need a bigger office space.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:41"><subtitle>
You come to work, clock in,you put sugar in your coffee,and watch it slowly disappearinto nothingness.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:47"><subtitle>
But the sugar doesn't know why.Sugar didn't ask to be born.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:50"><subtitle>
Is he okay?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:51"><subtitle>
He recently found outthat his brother's sick.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:53"><subtitle>
Oh. I'm so sorry,but you know what else is sick?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:56"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:01"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:05"><subtitle>
Losing BoJack was a blow.There's no way to sugarcoat it,even if I were generally goodat sugarcoating things, which I'm not.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:11"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description> You know, I wishcats really did have nine lives.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:15"><subtitle>
It would make me feel betterabout how much I'm screwing up this one.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:18"><subtitle>
You're not screwing up your life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:19"><subtitle>
Sometimes I feel like,if I could start everything over,knowing what I know now,I'd do it all right this time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:25"><subtitle>
But other times I think...<description>sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:27"><subtitle>
No, I wouldn't.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:31"><subtitle>
As you all know, things have been rough,and, unfortunately,we have to scale back our staff.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:36"><subtitle>
-Mainly, you.-Are you firing me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:38"><subtitle>
In a sense, yes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:40"><subtitle>
But, in another sense,I'm promoting youto a position of finding a jobsomewhere else.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:45"><subtitle>
Yeah. I don't think I ever thanked youfor giving me this job in the first place.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:50"><subtitle>
It was an honor to work with you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:52"><subtitle>
You were the worst social mediacoordinator this company ever had.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:58"><subtitle>
Are you sure you need surgery?Can't you get a second opinion?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:01"><subtitle>
Second opinion? You knowthere's only one doctor on the Peninsula.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:05"><subtitle>
I could ask him twiceif it'd make you feel better.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:07"><subtitle>
Nothing could make mefeel better right now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:09"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:12:12"><subtitle>
It's really not that big of a deal.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:14"><subtitle>
Hey, sorry about that.Just got a call from the Oscars.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:17"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:40"><subtitle>
I'm cold. Will you pass me that blanket?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:42"><subtitle>
Boy, that old gal had somethingfor everything, didn't she?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:45"><subtitle>
I know you're worried about me,but sitting around the house worryingisn't going to help anyone.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:49"><subtitle>
Okay, but you'll call mewhen you get out of the surgery, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:52"><subtitle>
I'm not gonna let my phone leave my sight.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:54"><subtitle>
Of course. And now,I've got something new to live for.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:50"><subtitle>

Oh, my God, that's incredible!</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:15:00"><subtitle>
Okay. Now, where's the... the...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:02"><subtitle>
Uh-oh. Could've sworn it was right here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:05"><subtitle>
-Oh!-<description>panting</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:06"><subtitle>
Oh! There you are.You need to get on stage.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:09"><subtitle>
Yes, just as soon as you give me thatbackup envelope, please and por favor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:13"><subtitle>
What back-up envelope?There is no back-up envelope.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:17"><subtitle>
That was a test and you passed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:19"><subtitle>
Wunderbar.Now, let's get you out there.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:20"><subtitle>
Yes, gotta get out there, on to the stage,to announce the nominations.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:25"><subtitle>
Just as soon as I--Oh, my God, is that Bradley Cooper?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:28"><subtitle>
Bradley Cooper?We love him for some reason.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:30"><subtitle>
-Where?-Let's go, Todd.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:33"><subtitle>
-Oh, God, what do we do?-It's okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:35"><subtitle>
We just need to come upwith all the nominees ourselves.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:37"><subtitle>
But I haven't even seen all the movies.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:39"><subtitle>
Todd, nobody has.That's not how they give out awards.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:42"><subtitle>
-But---Time for talk is over.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:43"><subtitle>
Now's the time for action.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:44"><subtitle>
And by "action," I meantalking about these 24 categoriesuntil we've settled on a list of nominees.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:50"><subtitle>
You need to tell me right now,are you in or out?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:52"><subtitle>
Well, when you put it that way,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:53"><subtitle>
I guess you can call mehigh-waisted denim,because, right now, I am very in.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:59"><subtitle>
Let's do this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:02"><subtitle>
What did you think of Frieda Pinto?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:03"><subtitle>
Are you kidding me?Anybody could do what she did.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:05"><subtitle>
"Don't take my baby.I'll give you all my Bitcoins!"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:09"><subtitle>
Wow. That is good.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:11"><subtitle>
Okay, for Best Picture,what about Avatar?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:14"><subtitle>
-That was a good movie.-True, but did that come out this year?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:17"><subtitle>
-I feel like I just saw it.-Well, there's no way to know for sure.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:20"><subtitle>
Let's just throw it on the list.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:22"><subtitle>
Ooh, do we have Daniel Day-Lewisdown for anything? He's always there.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:25"><subtitle>
Good catch! I'll add him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:26"><subtitle>
Daniel Day-Lewis.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:28"><subtitle>
Okay. We need one more nomineefor Best Actor. Oh, what about BoJack?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:32"><subtitle>
His performance in Secretariatwas as thoughtful and self-awareas we've ever seen him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:36"><subtitle>
-Besides, he's our friend.-Is he?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:38"><subtitle>
Whoa! I am surprised to hearyou say that, Todd Chavez.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:42"><subtitle>
-Let's dig into that. We have time.-I don't think we do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:44"><subtitle>
You're supposed to beannouncing these, like, now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:46"><subtitle>
There is always timeto talk about our feelings.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:49"><subtitle>
As my Nana Peanutbutter used to say,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:51"><subtitle>
"There's always timeto talk about feelings,because feelingsare the ceilings of our hearts,and a leaky feeling ceilingleads to a flood of blood.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:58"><subtitle>
And I'm cold.Will you pass me that blanket?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:00"><subtitle>
Well, I guess I'm just tiredof BoJack walking all over everybodyand still getting everything he wants.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:07"><subtitle>
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I thinkthe important thing to remember hereis that BoJack is a damaged individual,struggling against a sea of demons,many self-created, but still all too real.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:16"><subtitle>
Getting this nominationfrom the two friends he loves the most--you and also me--would really mean a lot to him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:22"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description>Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:24"><subtitle>
But did you really thinkhe was that good in the movie?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:26"><subtitle>
Oh, I haven't seen it. It seemed long.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:29"><subtitle>
And the final nomineefor Best Picture is Avatar.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:33"><subtitle>
Well, those are all the nominations.I will not be taking any questions.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:36"><subtitle>
Goodbye. I must go.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:38"><subtitle>
<description>audience clamoring</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:41"><subtitle>
I gotta say, we pickedsome top-notch noms.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:44"><subtitle>
You know it!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:45"><subtitle>
Boy, was I glad when we gotout of that theater, though.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:47"><subtitle>
I know. So many questions.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:49"><subtitle>
"Oh, what the hell happened?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:52"><subtitle>
Why were you reading off that napkin?Why are you guys running?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:57"><subtitle>
They have their nominees.What more could they want?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:00"><subtitle>
You know what's crazy?We saved the day today,and no one will ever even know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:06"><subtitle>
-Hey, we'll know.-<description>doorbell rings</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:09"><subtitle>
Mr. Peanutbutter, we know what you did.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:13"><subtitle>
Oh, boy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:14"><subtitle>
So, the good news is,my brother's surgery was a success.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:18"><subtitle>
And the bad news is,you're not nominated for an Oscar.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:20"><subtitle>
And the other good news is...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:22"><subtitle>
<description>voice fading out</description>...that each breath is a giftand it is a joy to live.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:26"><subtitle>
-What?-We are so lucky we get to be alive.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:28"><subtitle>
-No, before that.-Oh, I didn't tell you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:31"><subtitle>
-My brother's been sick.-No, I don't care about your brother.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:33"><subtitle>
First of all, manners.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:35"><subtitle>
Second of all, I think if you met him,you'd actually really hit it off.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:38"><subtitle>
Imagine me but with less"in your face" cool guy attitude.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:41"><subtitle>
Did you say I'm not nominatedfor an Oscar?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:43"><subtitle>
Oh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:44"><subtitle>
A lot of people are mighty steamed,but I feel like what everyone'soverlooking here is,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:48"><subtitle>
I got most of the categories dead-on.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:50"><subtitle>
That's pretty amazing, and I am notgetting enough credit for that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:53"><subtitle>
Did you knowthat Avatar came out in 2009?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:55"><subtitle>
-I'm not nominated for an Oscar.-No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:58"><subtitle>
But you know what they say."It's an honor just to be nominated."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:00"><subtitle>
Oh, wait.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:02"><subtitle>
So, I'm just like everybody else.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:04"><subtitle>
I know you're upset, but whatever you do,please don't get mad at Todd.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:07"><subtitle>
-Why would I get mad at Todd?-Exactly. This is totally my fault.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:10"><subtitle>
-He didn't even want to nominate you.-What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:12"><subtitle>
With the gift of hindsight,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:13"><subtitle>
I see now how that might havemade you even more upset.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:16"><subtitle>
But I realized something today,when my brother called from the hospital,and I think it's gonnamake you feel a lot better.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:21"><subtitle>
-What? What is it?-None of this matters.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:25"><subtitle>
Okay, I'll see you later, buddy.</subtitle>

<description>inaudible dialogue</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:33"><subtitle>
As a partner in the company,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:34"><subtitle>
I am prepared to forgo my salaryfor the next three months,but even then, we're goingto need some sort of miracle.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:39"><subtitle>
What are we doing?What was the point of any of this?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:42"><subtitle>
I wasted everyone's time for six months.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:45"><subtitle>
Soon, I'll get some offerfrom one of the big five agenciesthat I can't say no to,and I'll go back to being another cogin the giant Play-Doh spaghetti makerthat is this industry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:54"><subtitle>
-Is that the best I can hope for?-Not necessarily.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:57"><subtitle>
Although, there is one thingI should probably mention.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:59"><subtitle>
What is it, Judah?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:02"><subtitle>
Maybe this is an opportunityto live one of your other eight lives.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:07"><subtitle>
Yeah, maybe.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:09"><subtitle>
It's been a pleasureworking with you, Judah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:12"><subtitle>
I found it to bean above average experience.</subtitle>

And then, he said,I fetishize my own sadness.</subtitle>

I don't know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:34"><subtitle>
-Did you ask for water?-No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:36"><subtitle>
They're not supposed to give us waterunless we ask.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:39"><subtitle>
-Don't they know there's a drought?-You want to send the water back?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:42"><subtitle>
No, I want the water. I just...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:44"><subtitle>
I went to BoJack's houseto congratulate him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:46"><subtitle>
I'm not trying to pick fights.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:48"><subtitle>
Well, you don't have to see him at allif you don't want to.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:50"><subtitle>
It's not like you work for him anymore.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:52"><subtitle>
-Is he right? Am I a bad person?-Who cares what he thinks?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:55"><subtitle>
Why do you havethis weird fixation with him?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:58"><subtitle>
I do not have a fixation, Roxy.I worry about him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:02"><subtitle>
Okay. And last year?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:03"><subtitle>
When you came back from Cordoviaand needed a place to crash?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:06"><subtitle>
Oh, you could have stayed with me,or any of your other friends,but you went right to his house.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:10"><subtitle>
Did you ever ask yourself why?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:14"><subtitle>
They're filling everyone's glasses.This is insane.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:16"><subtitle>
Oh, my God. What do you care?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:18"><subtitle>
Hey, excuse me? Excuse me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:20"><subtitle>
Do you know you're breaking the lawby giving everybody water?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:23"><subtitle>
It's okay. I want the water.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:24"><subtitle>
Yeah, we all want water.That's not the point.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:27"><subtitle>
In the state of California,it is illegal for a restaurantto serve people waterbefore they ask for it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:35"><subtitle>
There is a drought.</subtitle>
