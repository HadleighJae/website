</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:00"><subtitle>
Okay, we'll put it on the list.We gotta watch that one.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:03"><subtitle>
What about the one where the writersmade Joelle dress up like a pumpkin,and the whole episode was fat jokes,so then Joelle got an eating disorder?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:11"><subtitle>
Everything was so much simpler back then.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:12"><subtitle>
She had to go to a clinic.She missed, like, five episodes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:15"><subtitle>
We didn't know how good we had it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:17"><subtitle>
We got to come to workand have fun every day,and we weren't worriedabout our legacy or awards.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:22"><subtitle>
...because buildings are supposedto be rectangles, goddamn it!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:27"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:30"><subtitle>
Then, you had to go pee.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:31"><subtitle>
Then, you came backcovered in toilet paperand pretended to be a mummy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:34"><subtitle>
Then, you took it all offbecause you decided Egypt was stupid,especially pyramids,because you think triangle buildings are,and I quote, "gauche as shit."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:43"><subtitle>
That does sound like me,but I don't remember any of that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:45"><subtitle>
I must have blacked out.Maybe I should lay off the alcohol for--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:48"><subtitle>
...and I said, "You're sittingon the pizza, Mr. President."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:52"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:01"><subtitle>
Boom! Boner! Pay up!What did I tell you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:04"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:18"><subtitle>
Why can't life be like it wason Horsin' Around?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:20"><subtitle>
All our issues conveniently settledin 22 hilarious minutes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:24"><subtitle>
You know, it's amazingthat it's legal for kids to be actors.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:27"><subtitle>
How is that not child labor?I didn't know what I was signing up for.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:30"><subtitle>
-I was three.-This is getting me depressed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:32"><subtitle>
-Let's do something fun.-Oh! Okay, you know what really kicks ass?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:35"><subtitle>
The planetarium!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:37"><subtitle>
You get crazy high in the parking lot,then you go in and get your mind blownby all the trippy galaxies and shit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:43"><subtitle>
That sounds stupid.I'm gonna be in charge of the fun.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:46"><subtitle>
<description>snorting</description>No, no, no! That was drywall.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:47"><subtitle>
Jesus, we have to startmarking our drugs more clearly.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:50"><subtitle>
-Let's just take a box of whiskey and go.-Whoo!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:53"><subtitle>
-<description>male voice</description> It was just so hard.-Wha--? What the--?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:55"><subtitle>
I was stuck in a terrifying cycleof drinking, lifting my head up,drinking, lifting my head up,drinking, lifting my head up.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:04"><subtitle>
Coffee, stale donuts, attention hogstelling boring stories about themselves?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:08"><subtitle>
-Jesus! Are we at a 12-step meeting?-Now, you're a detective?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:11"><subtitle>
Last night, you couldn't even solvethe mystery of where the toilet is.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:14"><subtitle>
So, all our partying wasan elaborate trickjust to get me to go sober?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:18"><subtitle>
No, Detective Pukesin the Washing Machine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:20"><subtitle>
You're here because I couldn'tleave you alone in my house,and I had to come today.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:24"><subtitle>
Gotta get my nine-month chip.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:25"><subtitle>
Chip? We've been wasted for...31 hours?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:28"><subtitle>
That's no reason for meto not get my chip.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:29"><subtitle>
That's literally exactly the reasonyou shouldn't get your chip.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:32"><subtitle>
Nowhere in the 12 stepsdoes it say to not drink.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:34"><subtitle>
That's not actually one of the steps.Loophole.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:38"><subtitle>
Take a swig.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:39"><subtitle>
If you have to listen to losers talkabout their shitty sober lives,it's a lot more fun to be buzzed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:44"><subtitle>
And I realized people don't changebecause they want to change.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:48"><subtitle>
They change because they have to change.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:51"><subtitle>
Oh, God. Boo!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:53"><subtitle>
Oh, booing is generallyfrowned upon here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:55"><subtitle>
How else am I supposed to expresshow boring these stories are?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:58"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:04"><subtitle>
My rock bottom waswhen I actually woke up under a rock.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:10"><subtitle>
Can't get lower than that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:12"><subtitle>
Come on!You people call yourself drunks?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:14"><subtitle>
Most of this is stuff I doon a daily basis completely sober.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:17"><subtitle>
Trust me, pal,we've done some awful things.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:20"><subtitle>
One time, I didn't wantmy friend to move out,so I used character actress Ann Dowdto help me sabotage his hip-hopera.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:26"><subtitle>
Oh, please, that's baby stuff.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:28"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:31"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:35"><subtitle>
<description>all</description>Hi, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:37"><subtitle>
Oh, like you didn't know?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:39"><subtitle>
Anyway, I once went all the way downto New Mexico to see a woman that I knew,and she had a young daughter, Penny.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:44"><subtitle>
Penny Carson. That's her real name.You can look her up. I don't care.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:47"><subtitle>
And first, I tried to sleepwith the mom, but she said no.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:50"><subtitle>
-Then, I tried to sleep with the daughter.-<description>all groaning</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:52"><subtitle>
Then, the mom walked in on metrying to sleep with the daughter,and I was like,"Oopsie-doopsie! Exit stage right!"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:58"><subtitle>
Oh, God.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:59"><subtitle>
The worst part is, I don't even knowwhat happened after I left.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:02"><subtitle>
Did I ruin the family?Did I scar that little girl for life?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:05"><subtitle>
I don't know. I'll never know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:07"><subtitle>
And that's just, like,one of a billion thingsthat I have going through my headall the time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:12"><subtitle>
So, anyone got a better story than that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:14"><subtitle>
Wow.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:15"><subtitle>
Didn't think so, bitches.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:17"><subtitle>
Where's my trophy, or chip,or whatever?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:18"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:08:20"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:21"><subtitle>
<description>tires squealing</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:23"><subtitle>
That was impressive, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:25"><subtitle>
I've never seen them cancel an AA meetingbecause everyone got bummed out before.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:29"><subtitle>
Uh, what are you talking about?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:30"><subtitle>
You told everyone about that Penny chick.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:32"><subtitle>
Then, you went on and onabout how you're never going to change.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:34"><subtitle>
Then, you chased the slug around,threatening to pour salt on his head.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:37"><subtitle>
-I talked about Penny?-Hey! We've all done shitty stuff before.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:41"><subtitle>
-<description>tires squealing</description>-<description>loud crash</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:42"><subtitle>
Most of us aren't as proud of itas you seem to be.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:44"><subtitle>
I'm not proud. I feel really terrible thatI might have really messed that girl up.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:48"><subtitle>
Oh, she's fine.I looked her up on Facebook.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:51"><subtitle>
She's going to Oberlin,likes Thai food and the smell of a fireon the first really cold day of winter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:56"><subtitle>
That doesn't mean anything.Everyone likes the smell of fireon the first cold day of winter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:59"><subtitle>
You know, I used to feel just like youbefore I got into this "12 steps" thing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:03"><subtitle>
They taught me how to make amends.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:04"><subtitle>
You just say you're sorryfor the things you didand you get a clean slate.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:07"><subtitle>
-So, what? Just dirty up the slate again.-Then, you just make amends again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:11"><subtitle>
It's a never-ending cycle,where you always end upfeeling good about yourself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:15"><subtitle>
-<description>man</description> No!-You know what?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:16"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:21"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:22"><subtitle>
And then, let's makesome goddamn amends.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:24"><subtitle>
Maybe you should start with the familywhose playhouse you just smashed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:28"><subtitle>
-<description>crying</description> Oh, no!-Oh. Hey, kid!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:29"><subtitle>

<description>sighs, burps</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:07"><subtitle>
Where are those two?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:08"><subtitle>
They did not keep their fridgestocked enoughfor two stoned peoplewaiting around for hours.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:12"><subtitle>
It's only been, like, ten minutes.You have a real thing with food.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:15"><subtitle>
That's what happens when you mixthe appetite of a horsewith the appetite of someonewith a hole inside himthat needs to be constantly filledwith attention, food, and sex.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:23"><subtitle>
-Pass the Bugles.-There's no more Bugles.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:25"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:10:37"><subtitle>
-Am I BoJack or Mr. Peanutbutter?-You can be anyone you want.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:40"><subtitle>
This is your dream... dream... dream...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:44"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:47"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:49"><subtitle>
That's cool. I forgive you.Wait, would my character say that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:52"><subtitle>
What's Diane's deal again?She's, like, an Asian Daria?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:55"><subtitle>
-She's a little more complex.-But she's basically Asian Daria, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:59"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:11:35"><subtitle>
Well, I also atea shit ton of Bugles, so no.</subtitle>

Whoa! I am a broken,screwed-up misfit toy,and you act all in control,but I know that, deep down,you're broken, too.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:13:10"><subtitle>
And I don't know why you won't justgive us a chance to be broken together.</subtitle>

BoJack, when I was in college,I had a job as a lifeguard...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:25"><subtitle>
Wait, did we just go to Ana's house?Did I get closure?</subtitle>
</timestamp>

If by "closure" you meanI lit her ottoman on fire, then yes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:30"><subtitle>
We gotta go back.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:32"><subtitle>
-What the hell?-I know I was just here,but I feel like you told mesome important storythat explained everything about us.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:37"><subtitle>
Unfortunately, I totally spaced it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:40"><subtitle>
Gotta be honest.I've had a couple beers.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:42"><subtitle>
Ugh! All right, I'll tell you again,if it'll make you leave.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:13:48"><subtitle>
-Oh, crud.-You want to go back to Ana's, don't you?</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:13:51"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:13:59"><subtitle>
"I'm a lifeguard. This woman's housesmells weird, or is that me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:03"><subtitle>
Pay attention, Sarah Lynn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:04"><subtitle>
Don't do that thingwhere you write down your thoughtsinstead of what the personis actually saying.</subtitle>

Tonight? I haven't seen youin two weeks.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:35"><subtitle>
Oh, really?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:36"><subtitle>
I just need to know what you weretrying to tell me about being a lifeguard,and then, I'll leaveand you'll never see me again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:41"><subtitle>
Mmm...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:43"><subtitle>
After I almost drowned, I decidedI would never again be weaker than water.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:47"><subtitle>
So, I became a lifeguard.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:49"><subtitle>
On my first day of training,my instructor told methat there are going to be timeswhen you'll see someone in trouble.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:56"><subtitle>
You're going to want to rush in thereand do whatever you can to save them,but you have to stop yourself,because there are some peopleyou can't save.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:05"><subtitle>
'Cause those peoplewill thrash and struggleand try to take you down with them.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:13"><subtitle>
What does that have to do with me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:16"><subtitle>
What the--?Where the hell are we now?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:18"><subtitle>
-Ohi---Ojai?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:20"><subtitle>
-We drove all the way to Ojai?-Let me finish.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:22"><subtitle>
Ohi, and here's the kicker... O.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:25"><subtitle>
-Ohio.-We drove all the way to Ohio?!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:28"><subtitle>
I wanted to go to the planetarium,but you demanded we come here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:32"><subtitle>
You said you had to makeone more amend, to that Penny girl.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:36"><subtitle>
What? No! That is a terrible idea.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:38"><subtitle>
-Let's turn this car around right now.-<description>tires squealing</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:39"><subtitle>
Uh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:41"><subtitle>
-I feel we didn't turn the car around.-No, we did,but then, you turned it back aroundbecause you really wantedto find that deer girl,so we decided to do a stakeout.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:50"><subtitle>
There was a whole makeover sequence,where we went to the malland tried on different trench coatsfor each other.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:54"><subtitle>
Do you not remember any of that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:56"><subtitle>
This is insane.I already scarred her for life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:59"><subtitle>
If I see her again, I'll just end upgetting my horribleness all over her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:02"><subtitle>
You think it's too late for meto go to college?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:04"><subtitle>
I always wanted to be an architect.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:06"><subtitle>
But one of those architects,where, at night,she's a high-end call girl,and, by day,she's an international superspy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:12"><subtitle>
-So, when is she an architect?-I don't know. Frontier times?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:15"><subtitle>
No, I didn't mean what era.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:17"><subtitle>
If she's a call girl at nightand a spy during the day--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:19"><subtitle>
-Hey, look, Penny.-Oh, God, what's she doing?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:22"><subtitle>
-Does she look emotionally damaged?-She's just going to the computer.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:24"><subtitle>
She's probably in a sex chat roomwith some middle-aged horsebecause that's the only wayshe can still feel love.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:30"><subtitle>
-Yeah, probably.-Or she's so upset about what you didthat she's using the Internetto find ways to commit suicide.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:36"><subtitle>
That makes even more sense.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:37"><subtitle>
All right, we've establishedthat you ruined her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:40"><subtitle>
-Can we go back to L.A. now?-Yes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:43"><subtitle>
So... obviously, I wanted to keepfollowing Penny because I'm an idiot.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:47"><subtitle>
Let's just nip this in the bud.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:48"><subtitle>
I'm gonna write "Do not follow Penny"on my handsin the unlikely scenarioof my blacking out again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:53"><subtitle>
I'll just write "Follow Penny"on this hand,and then, on this hand, I'll write...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:58"><subtitle>
-Goddamn it!-What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:00"><subtitle>
We're just doing what the hand said.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:02"><subtitle>
<description>groans</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:04"><subtitle>
-Uh, what?-The hand demanded donuts.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:17:07"><subtitle>
-<description>gasps</description> There she is.-She's drinking beer.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:09"><subtitle>

Ugh. Okay, now, I'm bored again.Quit hoggin' the 'nocs.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:17:33"><subtitle>
Too fine, like she's hiding a dark secretthat's eating away at her soul.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:37"><subtitle>
Or, possibly... she's fine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:40"><subtitle>
Maybe I didn't ruin her life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:42"><subtitle>
Hey, you were a father figure,who was sexually inappropriate to me,and I turned out perfect.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:46"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:18:33"><subtitle>
Mm-hmm.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:18:34"><subtitle>
-Until she saw you and freaked out.-<description>groans</description></subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:18:36"><subtitle>
But she probably would have beentotally fine if you'd never shown up.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

-Oh, God.-I think the wound was completely healedbefore you reopened it by showing upunannounced at her collegeand all the pain camerushing back to her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:48"><subtitle>
Oh, good Lord!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:49"><subtitle>

Oh, that? Turns out there'sa brand of heroin called BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:15"><subtitle>
Dude, that's a big freaking deal.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:17"><subtitle>
Getting a drug named after youis cooler than getting an Oscar.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:20"><subtitle>
I mean, there's Billy Crystal Meth,Angel Dustin Hoffman,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:23"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:30"><subtitle>
-It's too perfect.-I don't know.</subtitle>

Don't do heroin."</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:19:35"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:38"><subtitle>
I'm not gonna shoot heroinwith you, Sarah Lynn.</subtitle>

Okay, thank you.Happy Thanksgiving 2007.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:56"><subtitle>
Why did you just say what year it is?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:58"><subtitle>
I guess I just get nervoustalking to network executives.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:01"><subtitle>
This last episode gotthe worst ratings yet.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:04"><subtitle>
I was afraid your character trying heroinwould be a bridge too far.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:08"><subtitle>
-Oh.-And the disjointed blackout structure,with the one flashback in the middle,really confused our audience.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:14"><subtitle>
Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:14"><subtitle>
They hated allthe fourth-wall-breaking meta jokes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:17"><subtitle>
Of course. Audiences hate meta jokes.When will comedy writers learn?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:21"><subtitle>
BoJack, I know there is an audienceout there for our show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:24"><subtitle>
We just need to find a wayto get more people to check us out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:27"><subtitle>
I know what you're thinking--Full frontal.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:29"><subtitle>
I was thinking guest star.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:31"><subtitle>
We need a celebrity whois incredibly popular right now, like--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:34"><subtitle>
-Oh, what about Sarah Lynn?-Ooh, that's genius!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:37"><subtitle>
Sarah Lynn? I don't know.I haven't spoken to her in years.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:40"><subtitle>
Besides, she's not gonnawant to do this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:42"><subtitle>
She's the world's biggest pop star.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:44"><subtitle>
She's the only hope we haveto keep this show alive.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:47"><subtitle>
Would you ask her?I'm sure she'd do it for you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:49"><subtitle>
