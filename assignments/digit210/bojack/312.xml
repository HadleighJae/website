<timestamp time="00:05:45"><subtitle>
Character actress Margo Martindaleain't afraid of nothin'!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:50"><subtitle>
The boats are about to collide!We have to do something!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:54"><subtitle>
You know damn well,when we took to the sky,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:56"><subtitle>
we made a solemn oath never to meddlein the affairs of land nor sea.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:59"><subtitle>
We are sworn but to observe.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:01"><subtitle>
This is the blimper's promise.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:02"><subtitle>
Oh, no! The boatsare tearing each other apart!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:06"><subtitle>
Crates and crates of spaghettiare pouring out into the ocean!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:09"><subtitle>

<description>screaming</description>Oh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:14"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:21"><subtitle>
Oh, no!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:23"><subtitle>
The pasta is cooking!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:26"><subtitle>
If only we had some olive oilto reduce the stickiness.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:29"><subtitle>
But olive oil doesn't actuallyreduce the stickiness in pasta.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:33"><subtitle>
That's only a myth.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:35"><subtitle>
No! I've wasted so much of my lifestirring olive oil into pasta!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:44"><subtitle>
Disaster al denteoff the coast of San Clemente!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:48"><subtitle>

Joining us via Google Hangout</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:59"><subtitle>
is spaghetti scientist Carla Hall.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:01"><subtitle>
-What can you tell us, Carla?-Well, Tom, as the spaghetti cooks,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:04"><subtitle>
it will expand, smothering the town</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:07"><subtitle>
and tenderly broiling the sea lifewho reside there.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:10"><subtitle>
Is there any way to preventthis delicious-soundingenvironmental catastrophe?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:14"><subtitle>
The only hope for rescue would be</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:16"><subtitle>
if someone had an enormous quantityof spaghetti strainers</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:19"><subtitle>
just sitting around the house,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:20"><subtitle>
but that person would also needaccess to a fleet of driversto transport said spaghetti strainers,and in order to strainthe spaghetti fast enough,the drivers would also need to beincredibly strong swimmers,like, just as an example,hot, sexy killer whales.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:34"><subtitle>
Is there such a saviorwho could possibly fitthat ridiculously specificset of criteria?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:39"><subtitle>
I don't know, Tom, but as they used to sayon my favorite TV show, let's find out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:46"><subtitle>

</timestamp>

If anyone needs me in the next two hours,they'll just have to wait.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:00"><subtitle>
<description>Tom on TV</description> This tragedy truly putsthe "no" into noodle,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:03"><subtitle>
the "ruh-roh" in rotelli,and the "oh, man" in manicotti.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:23"><subtitle>
-had two sets of stairs.-What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:25"><subtitle>
One in the living roomand one in the kitchen. Why?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:28"><subtitle>
Have you ever been in a house like that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:30"><subtitle>
-What are you doing here?-You didn't answer your phone.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:32"><subtitle>
I was worried about you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:33"><subtitle>
<description>takes deep breath</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:36"><subtitle>
The funeral was huge.There were so many people there.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:39"><subtitle>
I kept thinking, "I did this to her,"and everyone was just standing aroundlike, "Well, this was bound to happen,"but... it wasn't bound to happen.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:47"><subtitle>
I'm really sorry, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:50"><subtitle>
I don't know how to be, Diane.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:51"><subtitle>
It doesn't get betterand it doesn't get easier.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:53"><subtitle>
I can't keep lying to myself,saying "I'm gonna change." I'm poison.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:56"><subtitle>
-BoJack---I come from poison.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:58"><subtitle>
I have poison inside me,and I destroy everything I touch.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:01"><subtitle>
That's my legacy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:03"><subtitle>
I have nothing to showfor the life that I've lived,and I have nobody in my lifewho's better off for having known me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:08"><subtitle>
-That isn't true.-Isn't it, though?</subtitle>

When I was a kid,I used to watch you on TV.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:15"><subtitle>
And you know I didn't havethe best family.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:18"><subtitle>
Things weren't that great for me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:20"><subtitle>
But, for half an hour every week,I got to watch this showabout four people who had nobody,who came together and became a family.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:29"><subtitle>
And, for half an hour every week,I had a home,and it helped me survive.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:35"><subtitle>
BoJack, there are millions of peoplewho are better off for having known you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:42"><subtitle>
Why did you never tell me that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:43"><subtitle>
I guess to preserve some fictionof journalistic objectivity.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:47"><subtitle>
-Like that's a thing.-I know you don't want to hear this,but you're too good to be writingInstagram captions for celebrities.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:52"><subtitle>
-I'm not just---I'm sorry, but you are.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:54"><subtitle>
-You know you are.-Okay. Thank you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:57"><subtitle>
And I wish you didn't get so distantafter you moved out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:00"><subtitle>
-I'm sorry.-You know me better than anybody,and you can't not be a part of my life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:11"><subtitle>
Tools! This is Brad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:12"><subtitle>
-I want to do Ethan Around.-Oh, very funny.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:14"><subtitle>
Is this Jeff from Hammers and More?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:16"><subtitle>
-No, it's me, BoJack Horseman.-Wait, really?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:19"><subtitle>
Yeah. I think now more than everpeople need shows like Horsin' Around.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:22"><subtitle>
I... need a show like Horsin' Around.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:25"><subtitle>
Okay, but this isn'tlike last time, is it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:28"><subtitle>
Where you say you want to do it,but then, I find outyou don't actually want to do it,and then, your mean publicist yells at me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:34"><subtitle>
And, at the airport, on the way home,I get one of those big pretzels,but then, I drop the pretzelon the ground,and it gets eaten by a ant?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:40"><subtitle>
What? No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:41"><subtitle>
You won't regret this, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:44"><subtitle>
Attention, customers!Please leave and never come back.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:47"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:53"><subtitle>
Please, please! I'm no hero.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:55"><subtitle>
I'm just a guywith some bowls full of holes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:58"><subtitle>
Thanks again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:59"><subtitle>
It's funny. You help outat one disaster area,and, suddenly, everybody loves you,unless you're Sean Penn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:04"><subtitle>
Great PR for Cabracadabra, too.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:06"><subtitle>
Yeah, you can't buy that kind of press,and you can buy most kinds of press.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:10"><subtitle>
I hope some of that pressmakes its way to this readerbecause she is not a fanof Cabracadabra.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:15"><subtitle>
-She hates it.-I don't hate Cabracadabra.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:19"><subtitle>
I just think it objectifies womenand contributes to a cheap and damagingculture of sexist commodificationthat undercuts the exact reasonit was started in the first place.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:27"><subtitle>
But, you know, everything does that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:28"><subtitle>
Cosmo does that.Kids' movies, athletic gear... statues.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:33"><subtitle>
Yes, but this objectification of womenended up saving lots of lives,many of whom were also women,so, therefore, not sexist?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:41"><subtitle>
I can't argue with that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:43"><subtitle>
Well, the good news is,you don't have to anymore,because I'm selling the company!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:47"><subtitle>
<description>both</description>Oh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:48"><subtitle>
You know, it's really too badyou shut down the agency,because, if you could've held outfor just a couple more months,right now,Vim would be rolling in money.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:55"><subtitle>
I'm really happy for you,but I'm actually enjoying my time off.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:59"><subtitle>
Ralph and I went on vacation.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:01"><subtitle>
Can you believe this onehad never been to Cairo?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:03"><subtitle>
Those Egyptians really knowhow to treat a cat.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:05"><subtitle>
And what do you do, Ralph,that you can just hop on a plane to Cairo?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:09"><subtitle>
Well, I own and operatemy own greeting card company,but everywhere I go, I have a free room.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:13"><subtitle>
-Oh, because you're a mouse?-What? No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:16"><subtitle>
-Because I'm a Stilton.-Oh, my God! Like Stilton hotels?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:20"><subtitle>
-<description>ringtone playing</description>-I gotta take this. It's my new agent.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:22"><subtitle>
-Hello?-So, anyway--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:24"><subtitle>
<description>Mr. Peanutbutter</description>Another offer? That's incredible!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:26"><subtitle>
-Ralph and I---They want to pay me how much?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:28"><subtitle>
That is a lot of zeroes. Sign me up.<description>laughing</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:30"><subtitle>
What is he doing?You never take the first offer.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:32"><subtitle>
<description>clears throat</description>Hey, Diane, what have you been up to?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:34"><subtitle>
Well, I'm just weighing my options.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:36"><subtitle>
-I don't want to just jump into my next---You know what you should do?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:39"><subtitle>
Ralph's sister Stefaniis starting a new website.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:42"><subtitle>
It's a feminism/lifestyle/celebrity blog/newsletter/community hub,and she's looking for a partner/editor/"bomb-ass super bitch," her words.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:52"><subtitle>
You'd be perfect for it.I'll set a meeting.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:54"><subtitle>
Yeah, that could be cool.Why don't you give her my info?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:57"><subtitle>
No, no. I'll just set a meeting.It's easy. I'm not doing anything else.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:01"><subtitle>
-Except enjoying your time off, right?-Right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:03"><subtitle>
Wow, another amazing offer!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:06"><subtitle>
It's like everywhere I look,money, money, money!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:08"><subtitle>
Even ten percent of thiswould be quite a windfall.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:10"><subtitle>
<description>groans</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:15"><subtitle>
-I like your friends.-Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:17"><subtitle>
And I like this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:18"><subtitle>
<description>both</description>Mwah!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:19"><subtitle>
-This is working.-I like it, too.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:21"><subtitle>
That was smart of youto think of Diane for GirlCrush.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:23"><subtitle>
You're always making great connections.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:24"><subtitle>
That's probably why you weresuch a good manager.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:26"><subtitle>
-I wasn't a manager. I was an agent.-Oh, right. Sorry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:29"><subtitle>
Well, whatever it was,I'm glad that it's over,because I don't wantto share you with anybody.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:33"><subtitle>
Oh, my God!Maybe that was the problem!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:35"><subtitle>
-Maybe what was the problem?-All this time, I thought I was an agent,but what if what I was reallysupposed to be was a manager?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:42"><subtitle>
-What's the difference?-It's a completely different line of work.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:44"><subtitle>
An agent helps a client find jobs,but a manager helps managea client's career.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:49"><subtitle>
-It sounds exactly the same.-I think I'm having an epiphany.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:52"><subtitle>
It's like I've been wearingthe wrong bra size this whole time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:54"><subtitle>
Okay, if this is the thingthat'll make you happy,then I totally support you,but it kind of sounds like you're justgoing back to the same sort of jobthat made you miserablefor the last 20 years.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:04"><subtitle>
No, Ralph. Don't you get it?This is a new beginning.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:07"><subtitle>
-I'm gonna be a manager!-Oh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:12"><subtitle>
-Wow.-Takes you back, doesn't it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:14"><subtitle>
Listen, before everyonegets here tomorrow,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:16"><subtitle>
I have a couple notes on the script.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:17"><subtitle>
Too many "yowza-yowza bo-bowzas,"or not enough?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:20"><subtitle>
No. On page 18,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:22"><subtitle>
Ethan and the Horse try to get Juliato put on the roller skates,and she runs out of the room crying,and then, the Horse says,"That went well."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:28"><subtitle>
-Anything about that feel weird to you?-No, see, the Horse is being sarcastic.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:32"><subtitle>
It didn't go well. So, when the Horsesays, "That went well," it's funny.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:35"><subtitle>
-Dramatic irony.-No, I get the irony.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:37"><subtitle>
That's not the issue.This is a guaranteed laugh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:40"><subtitle>
-You're giving me the cut to commercial.-And that's a problem for you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:43"><subtitle>
This is Ethan Around. It's your show,and we need to tell the audience that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:47"><subtitle>
-You can't give all the best jokes to me.-I don't know, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:50"><subtitle>
You really think I'm readyfor a "That went well"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:53"><subtitle>
-You tell me. Let's hear it.-That went well!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:55"><subtitle>
You're pushing too hard.The line's funny. Trust the line.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:58"><subtitle>
-That went well.-Great. Now let me hear you throw it away.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:00"><subtitle>
-Oh, like a-- That went well.-Yes, that was great!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:03"><subtitle>
And that was a great look,with the eyebrow.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:05"><subtitle>
-What if we both did that?-Yeah, yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:07"><subtitle>
I'm looking at you like,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:08"><subtitle>
"This parenting thing is gonnabe harder than I thought,"and you're looking at me like,"Now you see what I had to go through."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:14"><subtitle>
-Exactly. Let's try it.-Well, that went well.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:16"><subtitle>
<description>both</description>Hmm...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:17"><subtitle>
-Oh, my God. Chills.-Yeah, you feel that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:20"><subtitle>
-Yeah.-Now that's how you cut to commercial.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:22"><subtitle>
That actually went well.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:17:28"><subtitle>
This place has really gone downhillsince they got that new chef.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:31"><subtitle>
As I was saying, I don't think the siteneeds to be just one thing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:34"><subtitle>
I think it can be a big umbrella,but, like, also not an umbrella.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:37"><subtitle>
That's GirlCroosh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:39"><subtitle>
Sorry, did you say "croosh"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:40"><subtitle>
Oh, you do not needto apologize here, Diane.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:43"><subtitle>
"Sorry" is a crutchand "crutch" is an ableist term.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:47"><subtitle>
I'm sorry if that shocks you,but I will not apologize for it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:49"><subtitle>
So, can I ask whatthe business model is here?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:51"><subtitle>
Diane, I'm rich.I'm not doing this to make money.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:55"><subtitle>
I'm doing this to make connectionswith real womenand extend my personal brandas a real down-to-earth chicawho cares about real women.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:01"><subtitle>
Well, you know what's great about that is,if you're not beholden to ad revenue,your writers can--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:05"><subtitle>
Yes! That is exactly the idea,whatever you were about to say.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:08"><subtitle>
I want to give you a real support system,because, honestly, Diane,what you do is so croosh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:16"><subtitle>
That shit you said aboutHank Hippopopalous last yearwas supernova red hot badass.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:20"><subtitle>
It wasn't even on fleek.Fleek was on it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:24"><subtitle>
-Thank you.-One thing though. Is anything off limits?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:26"><subtitle>
Like, if you had to write a pieceabout your husband, could you do it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:30"><subtitle>
-Why would I have to do that?-I don't know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:32"><subtitle>
Because his companyis basically Hooters on wheels?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:35"><subtitle>
-He's actually selling that company.-Well, he's still a public figure.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:38"><subtitle>
What if Mr. Peanutbutterdoes something problematicand you have a real hot take?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:41"><subtitle>
If I have a problem with my husband,I'm gonna talk to him about it directly.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:44"><subtitle>
Okay, so what if you did thatand he didn't listen,and you knew that,as much as you love himand as much as he loves you,he's never gonna get it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:54"><subtitle>
And meanwhile, you also knewthat all your readers looked up to youand wanted to read your opinion?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:00"><subtitle>
Would you write about it then?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:03"><subtitle>
-You got the job?-I got the job!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:05"><subtitle>
Oh, my God! Can you believe it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:07"><subtitle>
In the same week,I sell a company for millions of dollarsand you get a job writing for a blog.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:12"><subtitle>
When it rains, it pours, huh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:17"><subtitle>
And over here is where you can keepall of your receipts,in your leaning tower of receipts.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:24"><subtitle>
I think my client can handle it from here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:27"><subtitle>
This meeting is just to give youand the other former partners your money.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:31"><subtitle>
-Sign here.-Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

Todd, as a millionaire?That'll lead to some interesting stories.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:47"><subtitle>
What an exciting development.How's that gonna change the dynamic?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:51"><subtitle>
-I guess we're gonna find out, right?-You can leave now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

<timestamp time="00:21:41"><subtitle>
I've always wanted to goto a super nice restaurantand order everything on the menu.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

Oh, yeah! That's, like,first day millionaire stuff.</subtitle>
