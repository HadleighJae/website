</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:11"><subtitle>
<description>man</description> And I said,"That's a terrible idea."</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:19"><subtitle>
-And here we are.-<description>director</description> Okay. Action!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:23"><subtitle>
Hey, Zoe. Hey, Zelda.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:26"><subtitle>
-I forgot my boombox.-And your deodorant.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:29"><subtitle>
-Pee-yew, mister.-<description>audience laughs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:31"><subtitle>
-Zoe, that's no way to get adopted.-Adopted, by me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:35"><subtitle>
Children, I'm a singlebreakdancing instructorwho can barely take care of himself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:39"><subtitle>
Plus, I'm too rad to be a dad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:43"><subtitle>
<description>rhythmic grunting</description> Ooh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:44"><subtitle>
And shake it up. Hah!</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:00:49"><subtitle>
It's fine, Katrina. If I didn't randomlywander into doors all the time,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:54"><subtitle>
I never would have ended upco-piloting the very planethat brought me to Los Angeles.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:58"><subtitle>
Excuse me, didn't you seethe flashing red light outside the door?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:01"><subtitle>
Of course. That's why I stopped...what I was doing to come inside.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:06"><subtitle>
<description>laughing</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:07"><subtitle>
Ooh, are you filming a sitcom?I love sitcoms!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:10"><subtitle>
You should have a character say,"Talk to the hand."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:13"><subtitle>
<description>laughter</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:13"><subtitle>
The hand! Not the face,where the ears are.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:16"><subtitle>
-Newsflash: hands can't hear.-<description>laughter and applause</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:18"><subtitle>
What do you mean the characterneeds to be more likable?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:21"><subtitle>
They don't teach likabilityat the American Stanislavski Theatre.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:24"><subtitle>
Look, this is not about your acting.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:25"><subtitle>
You don't want an actor,you want a blank canvasupon which to project your ownmawkish notions of goodness.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:32"><subtitle>
Some man for all seasonsup for a bit of anything--cheerful, optimistic, indomitable.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:37"><subtitle>
I assure you no such man exists.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:40"><subtitle>
But you're welcome to keep looking.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:43"><subtitle>
This D'Onofrio has had enoughfrio.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:45"><subtitle>
-Hah hah!-Hmm.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:46"><subtitle>
But my favorite scenesare when a characteris completely oblivious to somethingreally important going on behind him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:53"><subtitle>
That, dear friends, is where the sittruly hits the com.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:56"><subtitle>
-Excuse me.-Kind of in the middle of something.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:58"><subtitle>
-He's yakking away, tension's building...-Hey, you, sir.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:00"><subtitle>
...the audience is like,"Hey, turn around."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:02"><subtitle>
Maybe the person behind himeven interrupts him--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:04"><subtitle>
-Can we talk to you for a second?-Just like that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:06"><subtitle>
And then, when it would be ridiculousto go on even one second longer...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:10"><subtitle>
-My name is David Chase.-Do you mind?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:12"><subtitle>
Only then does he say,exasperated,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:15"><subtitle>
"What? What do you want?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:17"><subtitle>
I want your face on billboards,you beautiful nonsensical clown prince.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:20"><subtitle>
-Doggie-doggie what now?-<description>laughter and applause</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:24"><subtitle>
Kid, how'd you like to be the star of"Untitled Horsin' Around Knockoff"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:29"><subtitle>
Me, a star? But I haveno experience, no formal training.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:33"><subtitle>
Hey, you, you don't needany of those things.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:36"><subtitle>
You got "it."</subtitle>

<description>Diane</description> Hey, BoJack, it's me again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:40"><subtitle>
<description>yawns</description> Hmm?<description>groans</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:42"><subtitle>
I haven't heard from youin, like, three months,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:44"><subtitle>
so I'm calling againto make sure you're okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:48"><subtitle>
<description>overlapping chatter</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:50"><subtitle>
What's new with me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:51"><subtitle>
Well...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:52"><subtitle>
Monocle? No, I thinkyou're thinking of Mr. Peanut.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:56"><subtitle>
<description>Diane</description> I don't know if you heard</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:58"><subtitle>
but Mr. Peanutbutteris running for governor, kind of.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:00"><subtitle>
I want a comprehensive crisscrossof cold calls to Contra Costa County.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:04"><subtitle>
I mean, Christ, people, get me signatures.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:06"><subtitle>
First, they need to get WoodchuckCoodchuck-Berkowitz recalled,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:09"><subtitle>
which is basically impossible.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:11"><subtitle>
So that actually makes it really easyfor me to be supportive.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:13"><subtitle>
-<description>smooching</description>-<description>chuckles</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:15"><subtitle>
-How's the recall effort?-Stupendous!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:17"><subtitle>
Uh, no. We're about 4,000 signatures shyof stupendous,and the deadline's in a week.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:22"><subtitle>
Even if you don't get all the signatures,I'll still be proud of you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:26"><subtitle>
Maybe even more so.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:26"><subtitle>
But when we do getthe signatures we need--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:29"><subtitle>
-please note I said "when," not "if"...-Noted.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:31"><subtitle>
...then the campaign will begin in...oh, where did you say again, Katrina?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:35"><subtitle>
Earnest. When we get the signatures,the campaign will begin in earnest.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:38"><subtitle>
Right. Earnest, California.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:40"><subtitle>
Earnest is not a city in Cal--Why do I try?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:43"><subtitle>
Looks like you twohave everything worked out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:45"><subtitle>
Just please notethat I am being supportive.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:48"><subtitle>
Noted!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:49"><subtitle>
<description>Diane</description> Most women wouldn't likehaving their husband's ex-wife</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:51"><subtitle>
hanging around all the time,but I'm totally cool with it</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:53"><subtitle>
because she makes me looksuper chill by comparison.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:56"><subtitle>
Oh, uh-- okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:58"><subtitle>
Anyway, call me back.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:00"><subtitle>
This is Diane, by the way.Nguyen, obviously.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:06"><subtitle>
You sure you wouldn't ratherjust play a governorin a movie or TV show?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:09"><subtitle>
I could attach Tommy Schlammeto direct.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:11"><subtitle>
Tommy Schlamme, shmommy Schlamme.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:14"><subtitle>
This is bigger than all that.Don't you recall?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:16"><subtitle>
-Recall what?-The governor. We need signatures.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:19"><subtitle>
Oh, sure.Where do you stand on the issues?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:21"><subtitle>
Oh, he doesn't stand anywhere on issuesbecause he's not running for governor yet.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:25"><subtitle>
I'm mainly for people right nowand also for the future.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:29"><subtitle>
<description>groans</description>Listen, I'm not feeling so hot.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:32"><subtitle>
Why don't you go getsignatures downstairs.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:34"><subtitle>
Jennifer Garner's in the lobby.She'll sign on to anything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:37"><subtitle>
Judah! Can I get your John Wilkes Hancock?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:40"><subtitle>
Oh, I never developed a signature.I find them unnecessarily ostentatious.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:43"><subtitle>
But I can print my name legibly.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:45"><subtitle>
Thank you, Rain Man-bun.That'll do nicely.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:47"><subtitle>
-Okay.-<description>groaning</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:50"><subtitle>
Ralph dropped this off for you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:51"><subtitle>
"I always make a beelineto see my feline." Aww!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:57"><subtitle>
Also, you wanted me to remind you aboutFX's American Dead Girl miniseries.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:01"><subtitle>
Oh, that's right! What train wreckare we rubbernecking at this year?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:05"><subtitle>
They're doing the Sarah Lynn story</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:06"><subtitle>
and they're lookingfor someone to play BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:09"><subtitle>
Oh! <description>retching, coughing</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:12"><subtitle>
Well, as I was saying, FX is lookingfor a BoJack Horseman--</subtitle>
</timestamp>

-<description>moaning</description>-So, as we discussed earlier,is this one of the momentswhere you would want privacy?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:27"><subtitle>
You know what I'd doif I had eight million dollars?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:30"><subtitle>
-Yeah, you'd give it to the waitress.-Oh, no, no, no.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:32"><subtitle>
I mean, if I hadeight million dollars now,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:35"><subtitle>
I'd start a company that makesremote-controlled drones.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:38"><subtitle>
But these drones have a seathanging from the bottomso you can fly around in it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:43"><subtitle>
A drone with a throne.A drone throne.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:47"><subtitle>
But if you're in it, isn't it not a drone?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:50"><subtitle>
I feel like you're gettingreally hung up on labels.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:53"><subtitle>
Well, anyways,with my eight million dollars</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:55"><subtitle>
I'm starting a new dating appjust for firemenand redheaded women named Emily.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:03"><subtitle>
Todd, you're great.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:05"><subtitle>
What a way to end a sentence.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:06"><subtitle>
But I want a boyfriend who isn't asexual.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:10"><subtitle>
Whoa. Why did you call me that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:12"><subtitle>
No, no, it's not bad.I didn't mean it negatively.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:14"><subtitle>
-I was just, like, stating it.-I'm not-- that word doesn't describe--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:18"><subtitle>
Okay, okay, I'm sorry,whatever you call yourself,you're my friend and I support you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:23"><subtitle>
But sometimes labels can be helpful.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:26"><subtitle>
Wow. Well, I would labelthis conversation "rough".</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:30"><subtitle>
Here's the check.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:32"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:41"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:43"><subtitle>
I wrote a story aboutan all-girl refugee kickball league.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:45"><subtitle>
It didn't get as many clicks as Gillian'sstory about how in certain pictures</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:48"><subtitle>
you can see the outlineof Chris Hemsworth's penis</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:50"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:52"><subtitle>

I don't like not knowing where you are,especially when we live three freewaysand an unprotected left turnaway from each other.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:22"><subtitle>

Oh, okay.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:08:35"><subtitle>
-I'm sorry.-No, no, it's fine. There's no hurry.</subtitle>

I haven't been this nervoussince Diane was vacuumingduring a thunderstormon the Fourth of July,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:13"><subtitle>
I had to take a bath,and there was a stranger in our yard.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:16"><subtitle>
There's no need to be nervous,or calm for that matterbecause you've already lost.</subtitle>

We're 1,600 signatures shortand the clock runs out at 9:00 AM.</subtitle>

Whoa! Whoa!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:44"><subtitle>
I don't understand what happened.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:46"><subtitle>
Let me put it in termsyour dumb dog brain can comprehend.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:49"><subtitle>
All your life people have beenthrowing you bonesbecause they like you,but everyone has a ceilingto their likability.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:56"><subtitle>
This is a bone you can't have,because people just don't like you enough.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:03"><subtitle>
-I'm sorry, Mr. Peanutbutter.-You know, it's funny.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:06"><subtitle>
Personally I like Woodchuckand he's a fine governor,but for some reason, even thoughI have zero qualifications,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:12"><subtitle>
I honestly thought I would have madean even better governor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:15"><subtitle>
-Well, what matters is you tried.-But I would have been good, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:18"><subtitle>
Now that there's no chanceyou will ever be governor,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:21"><subtitle>
I can tell you honestly...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:23"><subtitle>
-Yes. You would have been great.-<description>chuckles</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:26"><subtitle>
Stop. But seriously, though, elaborate.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:28"><subtitle>
You care about people,you follow your heart.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:31"><subtitle>
Those are important qualitiesyou should never give up on.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:34"><subtitle>
So what you're saying isI shouldn't give up?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:36"><subtitle>
-On those qualities.-Yeah. Never concede.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:38"><subtitle>
-Stick it out, stay in the race.-Uh-- no--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:41"><subtitle>
Uh, maybe we should getKatrina's two cents on this.</subtitle>

Moments ago I found myselfin what seemed to be a no-win situation.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:02"><subtitle>
But it turns outit was a "Nguyen situation."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:05"><subtitle>
I'm referring of courseto my supportive wife Diane Nguyen,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:09"><subtitle>
-who told me to never give up!-<description>groans</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:12"><subtitle>
And that's why I am challengingWoodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:16"><subtitle>
-to a ski race down Devil's Mountain.-What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:19"><subtitle>
No more petitionsor fancy ballot initiatives,just a mano a mano,no-holds-barred slippery slalomdown an ice-covered peak.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:26"><subtitle>
Winner gets to be governor,loser goes home.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:29"><subtitle>
Your move, Governor.Mic drop!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:31"><subtitle>
-<description>feedback squeal</description>-<description>cheers and applause</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:33"><subtitle>
-Aaah!-<description>cheering</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:35"><subtitle>
<description>Woodchuck</description>What the hell is he talking about?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:37"><subtitle>
It sounds like he's challenging youto a ski race down Devil's Mountain.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:41"><subtitle>
What an absurd conceit.Do I even need to respond to this?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:44"><subtitle>
No, sir.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:45"><subtitle>
Because I'd rather focuson my drought relief optimizationusing geohydration technology,or DROUGHT plan.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:53"><subtitle>
If I know anything, this storywill go away in a couple of days.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:58"><subtitle>
Now Mr. Peanutbutter, you challengedWoodchuck to a ski race a month ago.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:03"><subtitle>
Not just any ski race, a high-stakes dashdown Devil's Mountain</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:06"><subtitle>
-for the governorship itself.-But still no comment from the governor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:09"><subtitle>
Why won't he race you?That's what I want to know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:11"><subtitle>
You and me both, friendo.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:13"><subtitle>
But this isn't an us-ocracy,it's a dem-ocracy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:17"><subtitle>
-<description>audience</description> Ooh!-So let's ask "dem" what "dey" think.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:19"><subtitle>
-<description>cheers and applause</description>-Any questions for the governor, folks?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:22"><subtitle>
<description>audience chants</description>Why won't Woodchuck race?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:25"><subtitle>
So, to be clear, my DROUGHT planis actually a drought relief plan.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:30"><subtitle>
I see now how that's confusing.Any other questions?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:33"><subtitle>
Are you going to race Mr. Peanutbutter?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:34"><subtitle>
Any questions about the DROUGHT plan?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:38"><subtitle>
To ski or not to ski?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:40"><subtitle>
That was the questionposed by William Shakespeare</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:43"><subtitle>
and it's perhaps even more relevant today.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:45"><subtitle>
Of course, there are reasonswhy a gubernatorial election</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:48"><subtitle>
should not be decided by a ski race,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:50"><subtitle>
but are there also reasonswhy it should?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:53"><subtitle>
For the sake of "fairness"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:54"><subtitle>
we've brought in two expertswith opposite opinions</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:57"><subtitle>
who will now have equal timeto just say those opinions</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:59"><subtitle>
because that's what news is.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:02"><subtitle>
You think they'll really racedown Devil's Mountain?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:04"><subtitle>
What do I care? As long as I've gotmy giant bag of kettle corn,that's the only thing that concerns me.</subtitle>

-What the?-Drone Throne strikes again! Ha ha!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:14"><subtitle>
Get back here with my kettle corn!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:16"><subtitle>
You can't call it a droneif you're riding on it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:18"><subtitle>
Suckers! Hooray!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:20"><subtitle>
Ha ha! Oh-- oh, no!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:23"><subtitle>
Aw, man.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:24"><subtitle>
I was hoisted by my own petard,the one petard I thoughtwould never hoist me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:31"><subtitle>
<description>Woodchuck</description> Unprecedented poppycock.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:33"><subtitle>
This poppycock has no precedent.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:35"><subtitle>
Maybe it's time to make a statement.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:38"><subtitle>
Madeline, no.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:40"><subtitle>
This outlandish buffooneryis beneath the office of the governor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:42"><subtitle>
I can't defile the legacyof my predecessorswho built the Golden Gate Bridge,irrigated the Central Valley,and played Mr. Freeze in a Batman movie.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:51"><subtitle>
Can't you see this thingis eating you alive?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:54"><subtitle>
Do it for us, Woodcharles.Do it for us.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:58"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:00"><subtitle>
And so this ski race would be bothundemocratic and unconstitutional,which is why I will not be racingMr. Peanutbutter down Devil's Mountain.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:10"><subtitle>
What if the state constitutionwere changed to allow it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:13"><subtitle>
-Then would you race Mr. Peanutbutter?-I... <description>sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:17"><subtitle>
Fine. If a state senatorwanted to waste everybody's timeby sponsoring an amendmentto the constitution,and the motion got two-thirds majorityin both housesso as to allowa democratically-elected governorto accept a ski race challengefor his office,then yes, I would race Mr. Peanutbutter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:36"><subtitle>
Well, I guess that putsthat idea to bed, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:38"><subtitle>
-Hmm.-Right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:40"><subtitle>
-Hmm... <description>chuckles</description>-Right?!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:46"><subtitle>
You want me to sponsor a ski raceamendment to the constitution?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:51"><subtitle>
Or you could sponsor the amendmentthat has a hidden riderdoubling farm subsidies in your district.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:56"><subtitle>
-Inglewood could use some farms.-That's right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:00"><subtitle>
I do have these campaign donors--uh, I mean, constituentswho really care about babies' accessto vaping devices.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:15:07"><subtitle>
I've always wanted to drive acrossa bridge to Hawaii.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:11"><subtitle>
-Can we do that?-You got it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:13"><subtitle>
Aloha! <description>giggles</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:14"><subtitle>
Hoo hoo hoo hoo! Whoo!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:17"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description> It tickles.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:21"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:23"><subtitle>
I'm astounded that it has come to this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:27"><subtitle>
But since the exorbitantly expensiveand astonishingly titled I Love Californiaamendment is now law,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:34"><subtitle>
I formally accept Mr. Peanutbutter'schallenge to a ski race.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:38"><subtitle>
It happens that I'm an excellent skierwho won numerous medals in the sportwhen I raced for Dartmouthbut, again, I am shockedthat fact is relevantin the matter of selectingour state's governor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:48"><subtitle>
Mr. Peanutbutter, I will see youon Devil's Mountain.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:54"><subtitle>
-Whoa!-This is insane.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:56"><subtitle>
You could actually become governorby winning a race.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:58"><subtitle>
Yeah. Wow.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:00"><subtitle>
You know, it's days like thisI wish I knew how to ski.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:04"><subtitle>
-You don't ski?-Never really got into it, no.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:07"><subtitle>
Then why did you challenge the governorto a ski race?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:11"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description> I didn't thinkit would get this far.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:13"><subtitle>
You gotta admit, this is pretty out there.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:15"><subtitle>
Well, I guess that's it. Oh, well.Tough break. Bye forever, Katrina.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:18"><subtitle>
No, this is not over.This is just beginning.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:21"><subtitle>
Mr. Peanutbutter,you're going to ski school.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:25"><subtitle>
Doggie-doggie what now?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:27"><subtitle>
<description>Diane</description> Hey, BoJack, it's me again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:29"><subtitle>
Where are you, I'm worried,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:31"><subtitle>
hope you're not dead,etc... you get it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:32"><subtitle>
Anyway, things are even crazieraround here lately.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:36"><subtitle>
Don't know if you've seen the news,but I really wish you were here for this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:39"><subtitle>
Well, I'm off to ski schoolso I can learn how to ski,so I can become the governor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:44"><subtitle>
<description>Diane</description> You'd say something like,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:45"><subtitle>
"That's the dumbest thingI've ever heard."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:47"><subtitle>
Sounds great, sweetheart.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:49"><subtitle>
But as the old saying goes,that's politics.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:52"><subtitle>
<description>Diane</description> Then you'd probably say,"A, that's not an old saying</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:54"><subtitle>
and, B, that's not politics!Nothing about that is politics."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:58"><subtitle>
This is so great!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:00"><subtitle>
Then you would be so overwhelmed</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:01"><subtitle>
by the unbearable ludicrousnessof the situation</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:03"><subtitle>
that you would get in your carand drive to Hawaii,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:06"><subtitle>
which is also a thing you could do now</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:08"><subtitle>
because of a new billthat cost our state billions of dollars.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:10"><subtitle>
It's all so great!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:14"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description> You know, it's funny,because the last time I saw youyou told me that you needed mein your life,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:21"><subtitle>
and then you just disappeared.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:23"><subtitle>
So how do you thinkthat makes me feel?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:25"><subtitle>
Well, wherever you are,I hope you're happy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:29"><subtitle>

Professor Thistlethorpe,the famously humorless yet somehowalso lovable ski instructor?</subtitle>

Peanutbutter, is it?Everything about you disgusts me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:13"><subtitle>
Uh...</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:18:14"><subtitle>
And yet, there might besomething in you after all.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:18:28"><subtitle>
First lesson, break your skis in half.</subtitle>

Oh, I don't have skis.Was I supposed to bring skis?</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:18:33"><subtitle>
-You didn't say that.-No bother. They shan't be required.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:36"><subtitle>
Instead, read this book of poetry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:39"><subtitle>
I'll see you in the classroom.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:42"><subtitle>

I'm sorry. I just felt dumbbecause all my life I've wanted a family.</subtitle>

But I didn't want it to happenjust because I got pregnant by accident</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:21:02"><subtitle>
-and then you got stuck with me.-Okay, first of all,if I get stuck to something,you're the prettiest glue trap I ever saw.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:07"><subtitle>
-You know what I mean.-Second, if that's how you feel,maybe you shouldn't get pregnantby accident.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:13"><subtitle>
-Well, I didn't try to!-No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
