I heard before he played trianglehe was in a prison gang.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:34"><subtitle>
I heard he was a tech millionaire.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:36"><subtitle>
<description>in French accent</description> There is a rumorhe is a foreign prince.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:39"><subtitle>
-His name is Todd Chavez.-<description>gasping</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:42"><subtitle>
And he's the most giving manthe world has ever known.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:45"><subtitle>
He saved my pregnant daughterfrom drowning in a shipwreck,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:49"><subtitle>
then he delivered her babywhile they rode on a piece of driftwood.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:53"><subtitle>
-<description>musicians gasp</description>-And then he circumcised her baby</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:55"><subtitle>
while they both hung from the ladderof the rescue helicopter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:58"><subtitle>
-<description>gasps</description>-Of course, before he did,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:00"><subtitle>
Todd Chavez explained that circumcisionhas somewhat fallen out of vogue.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:04"><subtitle>
They had a spiritedbut respectful debate,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:07"><subtitle>
and by the end my daughter decidedthat since we are of Jewish heritage,the boy might like to have the optionto become religious if he so chooses.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:15"><subtitle>
Sounds like he really helped your daughtermake the decisionthat was right for her family.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:19"><subtitle>
And last year, when our triangle playerdied of starvationafter getting his foot stuckin his triangle,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:24"><subtitle>
Todd Chavez took overbecause we needed him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:27"><subtitle>
-What a guy!-He is always helping others.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:29"><subtitle>
You know, sometimeswhen that triangle part is coming up,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:33"><subtitle>
I find myself hoping he won't show up.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:35"><subtitle>
No man should be askedto give that much.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:38"><subtitle>
-He is truly the best of all of---Whoa!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:41"><subtitle>
Oh, hey, guys. I was eating a taco earlierand I got salsa on my shirt.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:45"><subtitle>
I went to clean it off, but then whenI put my hands in the automatic dryer</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:48"><subtitle>
I forgot I was still holding the taco.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:50"><subtitle>
I got my hands all greasy,so I couldn't open the doorknobfor an hour.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:54"><subtitle>
What you guys talking about?</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:02:55"><subtitle>
<description>Katrina</description> So then at 11:00 you're gonna begiving a policy speech on fracking.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:59"><subtitle>
Fracktastic!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:01"><subtitle>
Meanwhile, all this talkof whatever it is you're talking about</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:03"><subtitle>
-is making me hungry.-Mmm?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:05"><subtitle>
Cheese? Yes, please!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:07"><subtitle>
Todd, don't distract Mr. Peanutbutterwith your weird pocket cheeses.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:10"><subtitle>
The issue is fracking and the peoplereally want to know your opinion.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:13"><subtitle>
Well, then, color me "the people"because I would also liketo know my opinion.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:17"><subtitle>
You don't have one yet.The polling research comes in today</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:20"><subtitle>
and that will decide whetheryou're for or against fracking.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:23"><subtitle>
Here's a thought:maybe be against fracking.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:25"><subtitle>
-It's terrible!-Diane.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:27"><subtitle>
Just my opinion.You don't tell me how to do my job.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:29"><subtitle>
Also, fracking is the worst. I can'tbelieve you'd even consider endorsing it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:33"><subtitle>
None of my business.Gotta get to work. Love you!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:35"><subtitle>
-Bye, hon!-But seriously, seriously,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:37"><subtitle>
if you come out in support of frackingI'm gonna be super upset. Bye!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:40"><subtitle>
Where you stand on the issuedoesn't really matter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:43"><subtitle>
What's important is thatyou seem sincere and emphatic.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:46"><subtitle>
Ohh. Are you a fan of charmingbut inessential Will Smith movies?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:49"><subtitle>
Because, slight Hitch,I always show I'm empathicby taking off my glasses dramatically,but I kinda lost them.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:56"><subtitle>
Wow! This must be what I'd look liketo a starving shipwrecked person.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:59"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description> When did you last see the glasses?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:02"><subtitle>
I was in a meeting with Princess Carolyn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:03"><subtitle>
She was sayingI'm always forgetting stuff,so I whipped off my glasses,looked her square in the eye and said,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:08"><subtitle>
"I never forget a thing."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:10"><subtitle>
I might have left my glasses there.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:12"><subtitle>
Todd, you never do anything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:13"><subtitle>
Why don't you take the campaign busover to VIM</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:15"><subtitle>
and get Mr. Peanutbutter's glasses?Can you handle that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:18"><subtitle>
I never know if I can handle anything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:20"><subtitle>
That's what makes my life so exciting.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:23"><subtitle>
-<description>both grunting</description>-Mr. Peanutbutter, there's a delivery!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:26"><subtitle>
<description>Katrina</description> He's busy! Just sign for it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:28"><subtitle>
I can't sign for another man's mail.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:30"><subtitle>
That's how I ended up with the cremainsof Cornelius Vanderbilt.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:33"><subtitle>
It all started when a young Todd--<description>grunts</description> I don't have time for this!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:37"><subtitle>
I've got a job to do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:38"><subtitle>
<description>panting</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:47"><subtitle>
-<description>Princess Carolyn</description> It's Todd!-It's me!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:49"><subtitle>
You are just the guy I need.You know the actress Courtney Portnoy?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:52"><subtitle>
I think so. She portrayed the formerlyportly consort in The Seaport Resort?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:57"><subtitle>
Courtly roles likethe formerly portly consortare Courtney Portnoy's forte,but she's got a new action moviethat's supposed to change her image:Ms. Taken.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:04"><subtitle>
You know Mr. Takenfrom the Taken movies?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:06"><subtitle>
-This is his niece.-Nice!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:08"><subtitle>
This was supposed to be Courtney'scrossover coronation.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:11"><subtitle>
But that's sort of been thwarted,unfortunately,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:13"><subtitle>
'cause Courtney'spurportedly falling shortof shoring up four-quadrant support.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:17"><subtitle>
Makes perfect sense so far.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:19"><subtitle>
The public sees her as out of touch.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:21"><subtitle>
We need to make her seem relatable,and the best way to do thatis to be seen dating a down-to-earthboring nobody like yourself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:28"><subtitle>
You can do that, right?You're not doing anything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:30"><subtitle>
I'm kind of busy today.I gotta pick up these glasses,and then tonight there was this meetingI wanted to go to.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:36"><subtitle>
This will take no time, I promise.Meet her for lunch.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:39"><subtitle>
The paparazzi will show up,pop some razzis.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:42"><subtitle>
I do love getting my picture taken.It's proof I exist.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:45"><subtitle>
Marvelous!Judah, prepare the press release.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:47"><subtitle>
"Portnoy finds joy in hoi polloi boy toy."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:51"><subtitle>
<description>panting</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:53"><subtitle>
Well, we didn't get the polling researchon fracking--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:56"><subtitle>
-Here you go.-Thank you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:57"><subtitle>
Because apparently when the delivery camesomeone wouldn't sign for it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:01"><subtitle>
Ooh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:02"><subtitle>
In the future, whenever anyone asks youto sign Mr. Peanutbutter's name,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:07"><subtitle>
-just sign it.-You got it, chief.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:09"><subtitle>
All right, Middle-Aged Yeller,here's what you're gonna do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:11"><subtitle>
You're gonna givean impassioned speech on frackingthat doesn't actually take a standeither way on fracking.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:18"><subtitle>
Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:19"><subtitle>
Good morning!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:22"><subtitle>
Let's talk fracking.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:23"><subtitle>
Everyone has very strong opinionsabout it,and I want you all to know,right here and right now,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:31"><subtitle>
I am taking a stand.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:32"><subtitle>
-I am on... your side!-<description>applause</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:36"><subtitle>
-What side is that, specifically?-Good question.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:38"><subtitle>
I am specificallyon the side of the facts,and also on the side of feelings.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:44"><subtitle>
-<description>cheers and applause</description>-Well, I'm satisfied.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:46"><subtitle>
Oh, excuse me,would Mr. Peanutbutterbe willing to sign this letterto our state government?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:52"><subtitle>
Yes. I'll write his name on anything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:55"><subtitle>
Oh, thank you so much.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:57"><subtitle>
<description>gasps</description> And down goes Todd.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:02"><subtitle>
And up comes Todd!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:04"><subtitle>
Aah! <description>grunting</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:05"><subtitle>
-Whoa!-Stay back!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:06"><subtitle>
Calm down, I'm not going to hurt you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:08"><subtitle>
My name is Hollyhock Manheim-MannheimGuerrero-Robinson-Zilberschlag</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:12"><subtitle>
-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuack.-Wait, wait, wait.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:14"><subtitle>
-What's your first name?-Hollyhock.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:16"><subtitle>
And your last name?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:18"><subtitle>
Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero-Robinson-Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:21"><subtitle>
Got it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:23"><subtitle>
-Wait, what's your last name?-I know, it's confusing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:26"><subtitle>
-I have eight dads.-How'd that happen? Test tubes?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:28"><subtitle>
-No. I was adopted.-Oh, of course.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:31"><subtitle>
By eight men in a committed gaypolyamorous relationship.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:34"><subtitle>
-Less of course.-But ever since I was a baby,people always said I looked likeBoJack Horseman.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:40"><subtitle>
-That's a terrible thing to say to a baby!-<description>skimmer clatters</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:43"><subtitle>
And I've always wondered if BoJackcould be my biological... sperm guy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:48"><subtitle>
I guess it's possible.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:50"><subtitle>
BoJack used to say his penisis like sun-dried tomatoes:back in the '90s it got into everything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:57"><subtitle>
I came to L.A.to get to the bottom of things.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:59"><subtitle>
I even bought a deluxe spy kit.Sorry about knocking you out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:02"><subtitle>
Once you have chloroform,you can't not use it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:05"><subtitle>
No, I get it. BoJack had oneof those spy kits, too.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:07"><subtitle>
He mostly just used the chloroformon himself, though.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:10"><subtitle>
I read in his book that you live together.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:13"><subtitle>
-Can you help me find him?-Sorry. I don't live there anymore.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:16"><subtitle>
And no one knows where he's beenfor the last year.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:18"><subtitle>
I guess I don't have to meet him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:20"><subtitle>
All I need is a DNA sample,like a piece of hair or something.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:24"><subtitle>
-I guess his house might have-- <description>gasps</description>-<description>grunts</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:27"><subtitle>
-Whoa!-Sorry again. It's just so fun.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:30"><subtitle>
Okay, there might be some hairsin the shower drain,but hard to know who they belong to.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:35"><subtitle>
Everyone who has sex with BoJackusually takes a long shower afterwards.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:40"><subtitle>
-Hey, I think I see a hair.-<description>moaning</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:43"><subtitle>
Oh, no, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:45"><subtitle>
-Yoink!-What the... was...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:48"><subtitle>
-<description>exhales</description> Okay.-Okay, let's blow.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:50"><subtitle>
Blow? Who's got blow?Save some for BoJack. <description>groans</description> Huh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:53"><subtitle>
Wait, Todd? Oh, shit. Are you gonnayell at me? Can I have the blow first?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:56"><subtitle>
No. BoJack, there's no blow, okay?And I'm not going to yell at you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:00"><subtitle>
And what is this?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:01"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:10"><subtitle>
That was a joke. Obviously, I've neverheard of your family and/or law firm.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:15"><subtitle>
That was also a joke. Todd, who isthis tough crowd you brought to my home?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:18"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:22"><subtitle>
...dot-dot maid.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:24"><subtitle>
Way to build up the suspense.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:26"><subtitle>
To, uh, tidy up the placein case you came back.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:28"><subtitle>
You got me a maid? Thank you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:30"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:36"><subtitle>
-I don't know how to tell you---BoJack, we haven't talked in like a year,and that's actually beenkind of working for me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:42"><subtitle>
So, maybe it's better if we justkeep things like that, you know?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:46"><subtitle>
-Oh. Okay. So then why did you hire me---<description>grunts</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:18"><subtitle>
1:00?I gotta go meet my fake girlfriend!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:21"><subtitle>
Oh, you have a fake girlfriend too?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:23"><subtitle>
Mine is a bunch of water balloonswith a blonde wig.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:28"><subtitle>
I suppose a fancy restaurant like thisis too fancy for a common mansuch as yourself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:33"><subtitle>
No, it's fine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:34"><subtitle>
You'd probably like to take mesomeplace rough and primitive.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:37"><subtitle>
Uh... do you want me to take yousomewhere else?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:39"><subtitle>
