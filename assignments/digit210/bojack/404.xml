Let me be the first to tell you:I'm bad news.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:16"><subtitle>
You're actually not the firstto tell me that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:18"><subtitle>
I can't offer you parental guidanceor advice or love or supportor prolonged conversationor interest in you,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:24"><subtitle>
-or remembering your name.-It's Hollyhock.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:27"><subtitle>
-And I'm not looking for another dad.-Great.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:29"><subtitle>
But I've always wanted to knowwho my mother is.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:32"><subtitle>
Your mother? What do I look like,Josh Radnor?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:35"><subtitle>
Nothing? Nothing for Josh Radnor.How quickly we forget.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:38"><subtitle>
Just tell me the name of the womanyou had sex with in December 1999.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:43"><subtitle>
That's all the relationshipwe need to have.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:46"><subtitle>
That was quite a timefor our nation, sex-wise...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:48"><subtitle>
<music> Oh, 1999 </music></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:52"><subtitle>
Actually, I don't need a whole long story.Just get to the point.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:55"><subtitle>
The point is I banged a lot of women.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:58"><subtitle>
One-night stands, two-night stands,nooners, spooners, hot-air ballooners.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:01"><subtitle>
So, out of all of these womenit sounds like you really respected,is there any chanceone of them got pregnantand then put the baby up for adoption?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:10"><subtitle>
I guess Marcy was kind ofa poking holes in the condom type.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:13"><subtitle>
Real nutter. Good lay, though.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:15"><subtitle>
Glad to hear my motherwas a "nutter" and "a good lay."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:18"><subtitle>
Can I meet her? Where is she?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:20"><subtitle>
I bet she's still in that same apartmentin the Valley. What a dump!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:23"><subtitle>
Can you take me there?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:24"><subtitle>
Help me find my momand I'll leave you alone forever.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:27"><subtitle>
Deal. But can we go in the morning?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:29"><subtitle>
<description>yawning</description> It's getting pretty late,I become a real assholeif I don't get a solid seven hoursof bed drinking a night.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:50"><subtitle>
-Okay, just do me a favor.-Ugh! What now?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:52"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:00"><subtitle>
If you're gonna be a baby,stay here for the night.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:02"><subtitle>
-All right!-Take the couch and be quiet.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:04"><subtitle>
Don't get on your phone and textall your friends how sweet my house is.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:07"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:03:39"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:55"><subtitle>
-<description>shudders</description>-Diane, this is the campaign.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:57"><subtitle>
Nothing anyone saysduring a campaign matters.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:00"><subtitle>
It's just promising a bunch of stuffto get people to vote for you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:03"><subtitle>
Then when you get an office,you can do whatever you want.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:06"><subtitle>
-Democracy in action.-Mark my words--the only frackingthat's going to be happening</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:11"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:21"><subtitle>
-This isn't sexy for me-- aaah!-Did someone say "busy day"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:25"><subtitle>
No one said "busy day," Katrina.What did we say about knocking?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:29"><subtitle>
It wastes vital secondswe'll never get back?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:31"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:03"><subtitle>
No, I'm saying you look sad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:05"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:29"><subtitle>
It's all right, it's not your fault.Making food is impossible.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:32"><subtitle>
Let's get out of hereand take you to your mom's house.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:34"><subtitle>
Should we do something about the fire?</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:05:40"><subtitle>
So, who is this lady?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:42"><subtitle>
It's actually a cute story.She was the president of my fan club.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:45"><subtitle>
You had sex with the presidentof your fan club?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:47"><subtitle>
Yeah. "Oh, my God, what a monster!"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:49"><subtitle>
I slept with someone who loved memore than anybody elseand dedicated her life to knowing thingsabout me and caring about me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:55"><subtitle>
How could I be so shallow?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:57"><subtitle>
You're right, I'm sorry.Finish your cute story.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:59"><subtitle>
That was the whole story.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:01"><subtitle>
She was the president of my fan club,I had sex with her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:03"><subtitle>
Then I didn't think about herfor 18 years, and here we are.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:25"><subtitle>
How many do I have left?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:26"><subtitle>
Well, let's just sayit's more than Harry Potter movies,but fewer than James Bond movies.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:31"><subtitle>
-Doctor, no!-What do you recommend?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:33"><subtitle>
Hmm. Have you consideredimpregnating a younger woman?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:36"><subtitle>
No, I want to do it with this woman.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:38"><subtitle>
You could try throwing moneyat the problem.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:40"><subtitle>
You're gonna want pre-natal vitamins,cervical mucus boosters,a "You Can Do It!" poster,and an iOvulate.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:45"><subtitle>
- "iOvulate"?- Let's hope so!</subtitle>

Marcy, hey.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:08"><subtitle>
-I knew it. I knew you'd come back.-Right. Um...here's a very specific question:after we had sex,did you by any chance get pregnantand put a baby up for adoption?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:16"><subtitle>
-Yes.-Wait, really?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:17"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:20"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:22"><subtitle>
BoJack, I'm sorry,I really wanted to tell you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:25"><subtitle>
But when I called the numberthat you gave me,it was for a sandwich shop in Temecula.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:30"><subtitle>
Wha...? That's so weird.You must have dialed it wrong.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:33"><subtitle>
And then I thought, well, you know,sooner or later you'd call me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:37"><subtitle>
Yeah, yeah, I was gonna,but then, you know, 9/11 happened...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:41"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:44"><subtitle>
Oh! I'm so sorry. Where are my manners?Please come in.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:47"><subtitle>
And that was just sucha tough time for our country...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:53"><subtitle>
So, once we introduced vicious knife-playinto our routine,it really gave our sex life the edge.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:01"><subtitle>
Love it, crooshed it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:02"><subtitle>
So the article is just abouta happy marriage with a healthy sex life?</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:08"><subtitle>
-Uh-huh!-So croosh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:09"><subtitle>
What about our readerswho aren't having sex with their husbands?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:12"><subtitle>
Isn't this just gonna make them feel bad?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:14"><subtitle>
Not everyone gets to havegreat sex all the time, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:18"><subtitle>
Ladies?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:20"><subtitle>
Diane? Can I talk to youin your office for a minute?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:23"><subtitle>
I don't have an office.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:24"><subtitle>
You said offices have cornersand corners are the patriarchy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:27"><subtitle>
Fine. Can I talk to you in the hot-take,cool-down yoga area?</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:35"><subtitle>
Have you been eating glutenand also not having sex with your husband?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:39"><subtitle>
Whoa, Stefani, that's not--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:40"><subtitle>
Diane, relax! This is not a conversationbetween an employee and her superior.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:46"><subtitle>
This is a conversationbetween a friend and her superior.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:50"><subtitle>
The campaignhas been testing our marriage.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:53"><subtitle>
Obviously, it's great to seeMr. Peanutbutter so excited,and I am supporting that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:57"><subtitle>
But if I'm being honest,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:58"><subtitle>
I can't wait for it to be overso things can go back to normal.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:01"><subtitle>
-Hmm. And what happens if he wins?-He's not going to win.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:04"><subtitle>
Did you see the new CNN poll this morning?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:07"><subtitle>
He could win. People do love fracking.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:10"><subtitle>
It's fun to say! "Frack! Frack!Fricky-fricky-frack" <description>laughs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:14"><subtitle>
People wouldn't love saying itif they understood what it actually was.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:17"><subtitle>
-So tell them.-I can't go against my husband.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:20"><subtitle>
What the frack? Why not?You gotta do you, girl.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:23"><subtitle>
I always say, you gotta do you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:25"><subtitle>
And if he's doing him,then who's doing you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:29"><subtitle>
Because right now,it seems like no one's doing you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:32"><subtitle>
<description>groans</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:35"><subtitle>
...and then when I was eight,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:37"><subtitle>
Lizzie Dunbar's mom rented us allFreaky Friday for a sleepover,and I got really sad because I realizedI didn't have a mom to switch bodies with.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:44"><subtitle>
Am I talking a lot?I feel I'm talking a lot.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:47"><subtitle>
-Yes.-Oh! I need to show you something.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:49"><subtitle>
Okay, so this may seem cuckoo,but I was so head over heelsin love with your fatherthat after we made sweet love,and he didn't call me again,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:57"><subtitle>
I just got so jealous, so I made a listof every girl he was with...and I found their home addresses...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:03"><subtitle>
-Oh.-...and drew Xs over their eyes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:05"><subtitle>
I'm loving this conversationbut I have to go the bathroom now,for non-me being weirded outby this conversation-related reasons.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:14"><subtitle>
I just keep thinking abouthow different things would have beenif you'd have just called me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:19"><subtitle>
We could have had a family togetherfor 18 loving years.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:23"><subtitle>
-That might have---<description>Hollyhock</description> BoJack!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:25"><subtitle>
<description>groans</description> Kids. What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:26"><subtitle>
Can you join mein the bathroom for a minute?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:28"><subtitle>
What?! No!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:29"><subtitle>
-Do you want me, sweetheart?-No, it's a dad bathroom thing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:34"><subtitle>
Uh... Hollyhock?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:36"><subtitle>
That woman is not my mother.She's lying to us!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:39"><subtitle>
Marcy? No way!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:41"><subtitle>
Look. This is from the premiereof Autumn in New York.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:43"><subtitle>
That movie came out in August of 2000.I was born in September.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:47"><subtitle>
Does this woman lookeight months pregnant to you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:50"><subtitle>
Why would they release a romantic dramacalled Autumn in New Yorkin the middle of summer?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:55"><subtitle>
Richard Gerehad just done Runaway Bride,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:57"><subtitle>
Winona Ryder was hot offGirl, Interrupted</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:59"><subtitle>
-so the studio got cocky.-How do you know all this?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:01"><subtitle>
I looked it up on the Internetbecause I saw this pictureand got confused why Marcywould wear a summer dressto a movie calledAutumn in New York.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:09"><subtitle>
This is a summer dress?I guess I don't know dresses.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:12"><subtitle>
BoJack, focus! That's not my mom!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:14"><subtitle>
So the lesson here isI was right to never call her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:17"><subtitle>
-Wait, so who---<description>Marcy</description> Are you okay in there?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:19"><subtitle>
-Don't come in!-Yes! Father-daughter bathroom time!</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:13:51"><subtitle>
I can make this real quick.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:14:02"><subtitle>
But your fits of sardonic japery amused,to a point, until you impregnated me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:08"><subtitle>
Suddenly, I was awash in dreamsof idealized domesticity.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
