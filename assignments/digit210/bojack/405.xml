I am sick and tiredof real-life gun violencegetting in the way of us telling storiesthat glamorize gun violence.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:50"><subtitle>
Why does this keep happening?Has the whole world gone crazy?</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:02:57"><subtitle>
To be honest, moms aren't all that great.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:45"><subtitle>
I feel like I didn't strike the right tonein the last phone call.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:48"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:52"><subtitle>
Okay. Thank you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

Courtney's beloved was outlining his planto curtail gun violence.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:09"><subtitle>
I'm just saying,if people have the right pumped-up kicks,maybe they can outrun the bullets.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:16"><subtitle>
All this talk of gun violenceis depressing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:18"><subtitle>
-Ms. Taken is a movie about empowerment.-That's what I've been saying!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:22"><subtitle>
It's Bridget Joneswith slightly more bloody murdering.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

We just have to keep the storyon Courtney,and not on the depressinglyunstoppable riseof real-life gun violence in this country,thoughts and prayers.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:06"><subtitle>
-Why would I...-You know Courtney Portnoy.</subtitle>

Football?You don't have the haunches for it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:47"><subtitle>
You'll only embarrass yourself,as in every other endeavor you pursue.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:50"><subtitle>
-But, Mom...-If you're looking to get knocked aroundfor an afternoon, why don't you just readone of your father's manuscriptsand tell him his proseis pedestrian and derivative?</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:16"><subtitle>
-Henrietta?-Okay, we're doing this?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:18"><subtitle>
I think she really doesn't knowwho you are.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:20"><subtitle>
She knows.This is just like when she pretendednot to recognize meafter my shaky choir solo in eighth grade.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:25"><subtitle>
I had to get a ride home with the pianistwho liked to tickle a lot morethan just the ivories.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:30"><subtitle>
When I made it home unscathed, she said,"Huh. I guess no one wants you."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:33"><subtitle>
Henrietta, could I trouble youfor some orange juice, please?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:37"><subtitle>
Stop calling me Henrietta!Nobody here's named Henrietta!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:39"><subtitle>
Henrietta, orange juice. Now!</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:45"><subtitle>
Hollyhock.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:46"><subtitle>
I must apologize for Henrietta.She learned to read on secondhand books.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:52"><subtitle>
Mom, do you really not know who I am?Me, famous BoJack?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:55"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:58"><subtitle>
Oh. Uh, okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:04"><subtitle>
So you seeI'm really quite ordinary and relatable.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:07"><subtitle>
Yeah, you put your pants onone leg at a time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:09"><subtitle>
Well, I step into my pantsone leg at a time,then my trouser-maidens lift the legssimultaneously to avoid wrinklage.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:16"><subtitle>
Well, right, of course,why else have trouser-maidens?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:19"><subtitle>
-Hey. Konichiwa, Princess Mulan.-Just leave us alone, okay?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:23"><subtitle>
I was giving you a compliment.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:24"><subtitle>
First, konichiwa is not a compliment,it's Japanese for hello.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:27"><subtitle>
Second, I'm not Japanese.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:28"><subtitle>
Maybe I could put somethingin that sweet mouth of yours</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:30"><subtitle>
-so you don't have to talk so much.-Whoa!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:33"><subtitle>
One more step, asshole.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:34"><subtitle>
-What...-Whoa, whoa, whoa!</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:37"><subtitle>
-Tell your story walking.-...the...shit was that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:42"><subtitle>
I don't know! My instincts just kicked in.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:45"><subtitle>
Why do you even have a gun?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:47"><subtitle>
Well, using it in the moviewas so empowering,and now I just carry it everywhere.Do you want to hold it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:52"><subtitle>
No, I am very anti-gun.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:54"><subtitle>
In fact, I think the whole idea of gunsis inherently--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:57"><subtitle>
Holy shit, I'm holding a gun.How long has this been in my hand?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:00"><subtitle>
-Slides right in, doesn't it?-It actually feels kind of nice.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:03"><subtitle>
Would you like to try shooting it?We can go to my gun range.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:06"><subtitle>
You have your own gun range?</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:38"><subtitle>
-You came out of nowhere.-Yes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:40"><subtitle>
I snuck up on you on purpose as a symbolfor the alarming creep of dementia.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:43"><subtitle>
-It isn't there, until it is.-Thank you, very colorful.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:46"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:49"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:52"><subtitle>
This is the most responsiveshe's been in weeks.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:55"><subtitle>
I think with regular visitsfrom you and your daughter--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:57"><subtitle>
That's not happening.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:58"><subtitle>
Seeing my momis like a Terrence Malick movie.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:00"><subtitle>
Every ten years or so is bearable,but more than thatand it starts to get annoying.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:03"><subtitle>
She won't last another ten years.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:06"><subtitle>
-Well, I guess that's it, then. Bye, Mom!-Huh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:08"><subtitle>
Come on, Hollyhock,let's blow this Jell-O stand.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:10"><subtitle>
We're gonna come back though, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:12"><subtitle>
We can't just leave her like this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:13"><subtitle>
You can do anythingif you believe in yourself.</subtitle>

It's the newest thing.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:14:08"><subtitle>
-there has been another mass shooting.-<description>groans</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:11"><subtitle>
I am totally unqualifiedto cover a news story this important.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:14:14"><subtitle>
But as a straight white male,I will plow forward with confidenceand assume I'm doing fine.</subtitle>

Princess Carolyn, if this keeps up,we're gonna have to put this movieon the shelfnext to that wacky vacation comedy we didabout the klutzy babysitter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

-<description>Todd</description> Ha! That sounds hilarious!-What the hell are you doing on this call?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:34"><subtitle>
Imagining that funny movieyou just described.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:37"><subtitle>
Okay, what do all these shootingshave in common?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:39"><subtitle>
Guns? Bullets? Who are you,Art Linkletter? Just spit it out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:41"><subtitle>
Men! What if we played upthe "Ms." in Ms. Taken?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:45"><subtitle>
In a world of increasing terror,our movie tells womenthey don't have to be afraid anymore.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:50"><subtitle>
-Yeah, now you're talking.-When you put it that way,it almost sounds like these mass shootingscould be a good thing for the movie.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:56"><subtitle>
No, no, no, of course not.They're a terrible tragedy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:59"><subtitle>
Thoughts and prayersare with the victims.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:01"><subtitle>
-Right, thoughts and prayers.-But...anything that makes women feel unsafemight actually help our box office.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:07"><subtitle>
But you don't want women to feel unsafe.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:10"><subtitle>
Of course not!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:11"><subtitle>
Nobody wants that,nobody's saying that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:13"><subtitle>
But if they already do feel unsafe,there's no reason not to capitalize.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:17"><subtitle>
Right, if they already feel unsafe anyway.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:19"><subtitle>
Exactly, we're not making themfeel unsafe.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:22"><subtitle>
We're just profiting, albeit indirectly,from there being more mass shootings.</subtitle>

-You know I hate guns, right?-I know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:37"><subtitle>
Although my official statedpolitical opinionis I respect the Second Amendmentbut I think some gun purchasesshould require the barest amountof background checks.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:45"><subtitle>
Mr. Peanutbutter,you know I hate guns, too.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:48"><subtitle>
Or I thought I did. Or I still do, mostly.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:50"><subtitle>
But being a gun owner finally makes mefeel as safe walking down the streetas a man gets to feel all the time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:56"><subtitle>
And that's an incredible feelingI'm not ready to give up yet.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:59"><subtitle>
If you can frack under our house,I should get to have a gun.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:01"><subtitle>
All right, that's fair.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:03"><subtitle>
I'm really proud we've found a wayto keep our personal livesand our political lives compartmentalized.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:18:05"><subtitle>
The old one. That episode got usinto the TV Guide"Cheers and Jeers" column.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:10"><subtitle>
We did not get a "Cheers."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:11"><subtitle>
You always could play the fool, BoJack.</subtitle>

Not painful, boring. This place sucks.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:18:53"><subtitle>
If I'm not getting creditfor coming, what's the point?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:55"><subtitle>
If only there was some way for herto connect the BoJack from the showwith the BoJack who visits her every week.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:01"><subtitle>
-Yeah, too bad we can't. Or can we?-Can we what?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:05"><subtitle>
Put on a live episodeof Horsin' Around in the nursing home.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:08"><subtitle>
-Good thinking, Hollyhock.-Uh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:10"><subtitle>
We'll do a Horsin' Aroundhere at the home.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:12"><subtitle>
She'll love itbecause it's her son BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:14"><subtitle>
-Okay...-Then after the show,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:15"><subtitle>
I'll come out and say hello.And she'll say, "BoJack? Is that you?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:19"><subtitle>
When her eyes spark with recognition,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:21"><subtitle>
I'm gonna sit down next to her,I'm gonna squeeze her handand get real close and say...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:25"><subtitle>
-"Fuck you, Mom."-What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:28"><subtitle>
I can finally tell her off!I'm gonna say, "Look at you,you old piece of shit,rotting in a nursing home!"</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:19:33"><subtitle>
-Now I have the power!-That's what you want to say to her?</subtitle>

Oh, it's gonna be great!I can't wait to see the look on her face.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:39"><subtitle>
Okay, let's do this. Let's put on a show!</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:19:48"><subtitle>
-Hey!-Bad news.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:49"><subtitle>
Hear about the mass shootingoutside Tulsa?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:51"><subtitle>
Terrible tragedy.Thoughts and prayers.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:53"><subtitle>
We really have to do somethingabout these men who go...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:55"><subtitle>
No, P.C. This time it was a woman.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:57"><subtitle>
A woman mass shooter?Oh, no, that really is bad news!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:01"><subtitle>
I just think this is what happenswhen you give women guns.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:04"><subtitle>
They start shooting people with them.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:06"><subtitle>
I mean, do they even knowwhat guns are for?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:08"><subtitle>
I don't feel safe anymorewalking down my own street alone at night.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:11"><subtitle>
Me, a man!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:12"><subtitle>
I am convening a seriesof congressional hearings</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:15"><subtitle>
on the matter of women and guns.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:17"><subtitle>
Because even one deathfrom the bullet of a female gun owner</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:20"><subtitle>
is too many.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:22"><subtitle>
What are my constituents supposed to do,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:24"><subtitle>
not complimentrandom women on the street</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:27"><subtitle>
because they might becarrying a gun?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:29"><subtitle>
We cannot allow our livesto be dictated by that kind of fear.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:33"><subtitle>
So you see, the trigger was specificallydesigned for a man's grip</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:38"><subtitle>
and a man's temperament.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:40"><subtitle>
Look, all I'm saying is</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:41"><subtitle>
maybe you shouldn't blame womenfor wanting guns.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:44"><subtitle>
Maybe you should blamethe constant societal messaging</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:47"><subtitle>
that tells us we are safe only as longas the men around us allow us to be.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:52"><subtitle>
So if you have a problemwith women carrying firearms,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:55"><subtitle>
you can roll up your sleevesand actually work to create a society</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:58"><subtitle>
where women feel safe and equal,or you can just ban all guns.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:05"><subtitle>
