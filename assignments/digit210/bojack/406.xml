If it isn't my favorite client,Courtney Portnoy,and also another client, Todd.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:27"><subtitle>
It's always nice to be includedin a sentence someone says.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:31"><subtitle>
So bad news first: Ms. Takenwas a miserable failure.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:34"><subtitle>
-Princess Carolyn---But Courtney, more importantly,audiences are going to adoreyour tour de force performanceas the forceful denim-clad court reporterin The Court Reporter Sported Jorts,the jet-setting jort-sportingcourt reporter story.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:47"><subtitle>
Yes, the film is spectacularly romanticand well-titled,but I need a change in representation.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:52"><subtitle>
No! Courtney! Before you fire me--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:54"><subtitle>
I'm not gonna fire you.Heavens, no! I fired my agents.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:59"><subtitle>
Oh, good. Yeah, agents are replaceable.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:02"><subtitle>
A manager is forever.That's the takeaway here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:05"><subtitle>
I think you'll fall in lovewith my new agent.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:07"><subtitle>
-Love her already. Who is she?-He.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:10"><subtitle>
Yes, he, he, ha, ha.<description>chuckles</description></subtitle>

Oh, fish.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:16"><subtitle>
We got a nice bounceoff of Court's engagement.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:19"><subtitle>
"Court" is what I'm calling Courtneyfor wordplay-related reasons</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:21"><subtitle>
that'll become apparentat the end of this sentence,but that bounce has lost its pounce,and if we want to keepthis name in the news,we're going to need a full-court press.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:32"><subtitle>
So what do you do after an engagement?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:35"><subtitle>
D-d-d-doy!Wedding of the century.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:38"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:39"><subtitle>
We're talking floral arrangements.We're talking procession of elephants.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:42"><subtitle>
We're talking Jaden Smithin a Clockwork Orange costume,reading a poem he wrote...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:47"><subtitle>
Does that poem rhyme? No!What are you, crazy? Of course it doesn't.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:50"><subtitle>
And, uh-oh, was someone lookingfor Sebastian Janikowski,</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:04"><subtitle>
Which is why it's so perfect.No notice is the new notice.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:08"><subtitle>
This wedding is so fancywe don't care if you have other plans.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:11"><subtitle>
-Total status move.-You're right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:13"><subtitle>
Being engaged is one thing,but I'm not sureI want to actually get married.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:17"><subtitle>
We can draw up a standardHollywoo sham-marriage contract:</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:21"><subtitle>
-three years, non-exclusive, huge payday.-Oh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:24"><subtitle>
And I presumeyou'll be arranging everything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:26"><subtitle>
As Courtney's agent I'm happy to help,but I believe traditionallyit's the bride's managerwho plans the wedding.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:32"><subtitle>
<description>groans</description> Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:36"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:41"><subtitle>
-Yes, you are.-Who are you talking to?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:43"><subtitle>
Keep it down, oaf.You'll make the baby cry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:47"><subtitle>
-Baby?-Yes, you are.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:48"><subtitle>
She kept asking where the baby was,so I had Tina get her this doll.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:51"><subtitle>
-She's totes into it.-Mom is "totes" into a baby?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:55"><subtitle>
Is it possible the babygot dipped in brandy at some point?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:57"><subtitle>
Or cigarettes, or regressive ideasabout immigrants?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:59"><subtitle>
-I think she just wanted a baby.-Coochie-coochie-coo...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:02"><subtitle>
You shouldn't indulge her delusions.It's not right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:05"><subtitle>
But she seemed really down.And you're never around anymore.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:08"><subtitle>
It was getting depressing to look at her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:10"><subtitle>
That's why I made her this pillowcase.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:12"><subtitle>
You just put this over her headand everything is fine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:15"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:19"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:23"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:25"><subtitle>
Oh, I actually have a big announcement.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:28"><subtitle>
I'm marrying Courtney Portnoythis weekend.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:31"><subtitle>
-Wow! Great, Todd. Good for you.-That's amazing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:33"><subtitle>
I know it's pretty wild for an asexualto get married, but...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:37"><subtitle>
Not really. John and I are acesand we're married.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:40"><subtitle>
-Really?-Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:41"><subtitle>
Our wedding was nautical-themed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:42"><subtitle>
Why nautical?Is that, like, an asexual thing?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:45"><subtitle>
No, man. We just really like boats.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:47"><subtitle>
Asexual just meansyou're not interested in sex.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:49"><subtitle>
Some asexuals are also a-romantic,but others have relationshipslike anyone else.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:55"><subtitle>
But involving boats?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:56"><subtitle>
I feel like you're getting really hung upon the boats thing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:59"><subtitle>
So, it's not weirdfor an ace to get married?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:02"><subtitle>
No, if you found someone who reallyaccepts you for who you are, go for it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:06"><subtitle>
I will! I mean, I am. I mean, am I?</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:32"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:36"><subtitle>
Probably because you're sucha good mother, Beatrice.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:38"><subtitle>
Don't say that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:39"><subtitle>
I was very nervousto have a baby in the house,but it turns out,all it needed is a mother's love.</subtitle>

Guess it's okay. I'm an amazing parent.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:34"><subtitle>
What if I left it in its room all dayand didn't feed it or change it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:37"><subtitle>
Oh, that's okay, too.I must be mother of the year!</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:15:05"><subtitle>
-Yeah, but it kind of works.-Does it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:08"><subtitle>
I'm sorry,I feel like we always talk about me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:10"><subtitle>
What's going on with you, Roxie?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:12"><subtitle>
-I'm actually glad you asked, I...-<description>grunts</description> Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:15"><subtitle>
Hey, Diane, can I get your adviceon something?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:17"><subtitle>
-Yeah, of course. I'm not doing anything.-Um...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:19"><subtitle>
So, I have this friend,and his nameis Darnarius McQuimberton.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:26"><subtitle>
Oh, yeah,I think I read an article about himin Real, Not Made-Up, Person Magazine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:31"><subtitle>
Darnarius is supposed to get marriedthis weekend.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:34"><subtitle>
And it's going to be an amazing wedding,but it's kind of based on a lie.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:39"><subtitle>
Should he go through with it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:40"><subtitle>
Well, all weddings are lies, right?Sort of.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:44"><subtitle>
You're making this big declarationabout how you're gonna staywith this person forever,but you don't actually know that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:50"><subtitle>
You're just saying it.The whole thing is a farce.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:52"><subtitle>
-Yeah, that's true.-But it's a lie based on truth.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:56"><subtitle>
Like, at the center of the farcethere's this nuggetof something real and pure.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:01"><subtitle>
And that strange beautiful somethingis why you put upwith everything else, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:06"><subtitle>
I guess so.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:07"><subtitle>
And sometimes it's hard to rememberthat pure, shining thingbecause it's been painted overwith so many argumentsand compromises and disappointments.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:17"><subtitle>
But you have to believeit's still down there somewhere,even if you can't see it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:22"><subtitle>
And maybe even the belief in itis more important than the thing itself,but only as long as you still believe it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:29"><subtitle>
-Does that make sense?-Yeah. Thanks, Diane.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:32"><subtitle>
You've given meand Darquimbertus McNaringtona lot to think about.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:11"><subtitle>
Beer bottles, lit cigarettes,scripts where the lead is female.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:17:24"><subtitle>
I assume your maidor gardener or something?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:27"><subtitle>
Well, yeah.But it's still super-obnoxious.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:17:30"><subtitle>
You're not getting that doll back.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:43"><subtitle>
-Why would we do that?-No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:44"><subtitle>
So you both agree that's a bad idea.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:46"><subtitle>
Perhaps you're not so different after all?</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:19:09"><subtitle>
So when did you get a daughter?She's new, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:12"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:15"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:19:32"><subtitle>
Maybe this time, don't do the thingthat makes her hate you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:35"><subtitle>
I don't want to,but every time she looks at mewith those big innocent eyes,all I can think aboutis every shitty thing I've ever done,and I think,"I don't deserve that kind of love."</subtitle>

I've been doing some thinking,and marriage is like a Tootsie Pop.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:32"><subtitle>
The lollipop part is a lie,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:35"><subtitle>
but at the center of the liethere's a truth.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:37"><subtitle>
That's the Tootsie Roll,and that's why people get married.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:41"><subtitle>
But if I married Courtneyit would be a lie without any truth in it,like a Tootsie Popwith just the lollipop partand nothing in the middle.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:50"><subtitle>
So, a lollipop? That's still pretty good.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:54"><subtitle>
<description>Todd</description> I guess it's a bad analogy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:55"><subtitle>
But I don't want a fake marriage.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:57"><subtitle>
I'm sorry I didn't realize that before.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:00"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:11"><subtitle>
Courtney got jilted,play the sympathy card?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:13"><subtitle>
I guess we could put out a statement.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:15"><subtitle>
That's your solution?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:16"><subtitle>
What happened to the guyfrom this morning with all the big ideas?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:18"><subtitle>
Oh, that guy dies at six.This guy's gotta get home.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:21"><subtitle>
I got seven kids and a wifewho's really into me co-parenting,or, as she calls it, "parenting."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:26"><subtitle>
Well, can't you tuck the kids into bed,read them some script coverageof the film adaptation of Good Night Moonand then come back?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:32"><subtitle>
-This is important.-Well, my kids are important.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:35"><subtitle>
Fine, both things are equally important.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:37"><subtitle>
Oh, my God, thank God you're not a mother.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:39"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:42"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:21:49"><subtitle>
If you'd like to never see him again,I have ways of getting rid of him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:53"><subtitle>
What kind of ways?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:54"><subtitle>
Asking him politely to not come back.Actually, that's only one way.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:58"><subtitle>
I apologize for misleading youabout the number of ways.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:00"><subtitle>
He's a jerk, right? It's not just me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:02"><subtitle>
I worked with guys like him at F.M.E.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:03"><subtitle>
When I left, I sworeI would never work at a big agency again,because I can't workwith people like that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:09"><subtitle>
You don't think I'm like that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:10"><subtitle>
No, because you care about peopleother than yourself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:12"><subtitle>
And for what it's worth,you will be a wonderful mother.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:15"><subtitle>
-You're not just saying that?-I never just say anything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:18"><subtitle>
I choose words very carefully,with an eye towards precisionand expediency.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:22"><subtitle>
I'm surprised you haven't noticed that.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:35"><subtitle>
Just drive around.Sometimes I go to a bar.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:38"><subtitle>
Sometimes I pull overby the side of the road,just sit there for hours.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:42"><subtitle>
Why?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:45"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:47"><subtitle>
-than spend time with me?-Hollyhock...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:49"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:53"><subtitle>
And I'm sorry if I'm annoying,but I didn't ask...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:55"><subtitle>
-No, Hollyhock, I'm glad you're here.-Oh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:58"><subtitle>
If I'm shitty,that's just because I'm shitty.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:00"><subtitle>
You're allowed to be mad at me,but you need to know that whatever I do,it's not your fault.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:07"><subtitle>
I know. I mean, I know,but I don't always know, you know?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:12"><subtitle>
Like, sometimes I have this tiny voicein the back of my head that goes, like,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:15"><subtitle>
"Hey, everyone hates you!And they're not wrong to feel that way!"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:19"><subtitle>
I know what you mean.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:21"><subtitle>
That voice, the one that tells youyou're worthless and stupid and ugly?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:25"><subtitle>
-Yeah?-It goes away, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:28"><subtitle>
It's just, like, a dumb teenage-girlthing, but then it goes away?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:33"><subtitle>
Yeah.</subtitle>
