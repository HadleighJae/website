It's okay.Don't feel bad about feeling bad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:39"><subtitle>
You disappeared for a year and a half.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:42"><subtitle>
So you do want to talk about it.Just took four solid days of drinking.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:45"><subtitle>
If you were back in L.A.,why didn't you call me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:48"><subtitle>
-I wasn't... ready.-Ready? For what?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:52"><subtitle>
I wanted to be betterwhen you saw me again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:55"><subtitle>
And I thought I could be, somehow.But I'm not.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:58"><subtitle>
And even if I did get better,the best I could ever beis still just some other version of me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:04"><subtitle>
BoJack, I can't wait for you to be better.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:08"><subtitle>
I need you in my life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:10"><subtitle>
-Really?-You're the biggest asshole I know,and you're the only thingthat makes sense to me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:16"><subtitle>
<description>Diane sighs, moans</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:20"><subtitle>
People should be able to havesome control over their lives down here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:24"><subtitle>
-Yeah!-People need boundaries.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:25"><subtitle>
Leadership meanssometimes being the bad guy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:28"><subtitle>
You hear that? Woodchuck's a bad guy!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:31"><subtitle>
I don't want a bad guy to be our leader.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:32"><subtitle>
-That's not...-That's a point for Mr. Peanutbutter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:34"><subtitle>
And I'm the good guy,so that's two points for me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:37"><subtitle>
What points? There are no points.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:39"><subtitle>
-This is not a game!-Well, maybe there should be points.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:42"><subtitle>
-Yeah!-Points!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:43"><subtitle>
People seem to like my points idea.That's another point for me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:46"><subtitle>
Well, I'm the one who came down hereto save you in the first place.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:49"><subtitle>
Surely I get points for that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:51"><subtitle>
Asking for points is conceited.That's more points for me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:54"><subtitle>
-He's right!-What?!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:55"><subtitle>
If you came down to save us,why are we still here?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:57"><subtitle>
<description>all</description> Yeah!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:58"><subtitle>
You had one job, and you couldn't do it!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:00"><subtitle>
-Yeah!-That's right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:01"><subtitle>
Minus point for Woodchuck.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:02"><subtitle>
I implore you not to fallinto a mob mentality.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:06"><subtitle>
-He called us a mob! Let's kill him!-Yeah!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:08"><subtitle>
Folks, Woodchuck's political philosophyis as broken as his hands.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:12"><subtitle>
That is a convincing argument.He does have broken hands.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:15"><subtitle>
Maybe it's time an outsider took control.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:15:18"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:13"><subtitle>
Did she try sending mutual consent formto the adoption agency?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:16"><subtitle>
What, what words?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:17"><subtitle>
Well, if it's closed adoption,you send a mutual consent form.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:21"><subtitle>
Basically says, "I wanna be open now!"</subtitle>
