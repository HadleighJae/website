</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:10"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:16"><subtitle>
No, I'm good.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:03:40"><subtitle>
Felicity Huffman's Booty Academy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:43"><subtitle>
It was supposed to be</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:44"><subtitle>
Felicity Huffman'sFuture Leaders of America,but it got retooled a littleby the network.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:49"><subtitle>
So are we judging who has the best booty?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:51"><subtitle>
Whoa, BoJack, no.That is so degrading.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:54"><subtitle>
So if it's not about their butts,then why is the other judge Sir Mix-A-Lot?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:57"><subtitle>
Because I'm an honest and impartial judge.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:00"><subtitle>
And if there's one thing I'm famous for,it's that I cannot lie.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:04"><subtitle>
Yeah, I guess that would be the one thing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:06"><subtitle>
Hey, can we go home now?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:07"><subtitle>
Being around all these skinny L.A. ladiesmakes me feel like a blob.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:10"><subtitle>
Well, I gotta shootfor, like, ten more hours.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:14"><subtitle>
Are you serious?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:15"><subtitle>
Apparently, it takes three hours to set upthe "badonka-donka-dobstacle course."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:19"><subtitle>
So making TV is like a full-time job?Then why is it so bad?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:23"><subtitle>
I just assumed people weren't trying.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:25"><subtitle>
Uh, I don't mean to butt in here,but shouldn't your daughter be in school?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:29"><subtitle>
Shouldn't you be"Sir Minding-Your-Own-Business-A-Lot"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:31"><subtitle>
I graduated early and took a gap year.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:34"><subtitle>
My friend Maryssa is backpackingthrough Europe,but lucky me, I get to hang outin this butt-infested warehouse.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:40"><subtitle>
Oh. All right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:41"><subtitle>
Someone better be checkingthe pH levels of that Jacuzzibecause these bitches are basic.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:45"><subtitle>
Hey, you wanna explore the back lot?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:47"><subtitle>
They got a whole area that was builtto look like downtown Toronto.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:49"><subtitle>
That's where they shoot the stuffset in New York.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:51"><subtitle>
Are you allowed to just leave the set?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:53"><subtitle>
What are they gonna do? Dock my pay?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:55"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:45"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:32"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:06:33"><subtitle>
It's about hope, and freedom,and powerful lobbyistswho pay me to electa governor I can controlso we can get legislation passedthat allows them to build private prisonson what are now protected wetlands.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:43"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:47"><subtitle>
Why would you hope that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:48"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:20"><subtitle>
I will consider it a personal affrontif you won't at least have a beer.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:23"><subtitle>
-I shouldn't.-What about a very caffeinated coffee?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:25"><subtitle>
-No.-Raw shellfish?</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:07:27"><subtitle>
-I don't smoke.-That's okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:29"><subtitle>
You can just stand around mewhile I smoke.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:31"><subtitle>
No, I don't want to.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:32"><subtitle>
Cocaine, then?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:32"><subtitle>
I so appreciate that,and I hate to be rude,but I really don't think it's a good idea.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:36"><subtitle>
Would you like me to punch youin the belly real quickso you rememberwhat it's like to be alive?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:41"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:42"><subtitle>
Oh, I know.I grew up around rich people.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:44"><subtitle>
But I'm actually good,as far as belly-punchings go.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:47"><subtitle>
Well, can I at least offer you a rideon our private rollercoaster?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:50"><subtitle>
Surely, there's no reasonyou wouldn't want to do that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:52"><subtitle>
-So if you decline, I will be offended.-Oh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:55"><subtitle>
Also, not that it's relevant,but the rollercoasteris specifically discouragedfor children under fiveand pregnant women.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:00"><subtitle>
But since you are neither of those,obviously, there's no reasonyou will not want to rideon our family's really fun rollercoaster.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:06"><subtitle>
-Okay, look, the truth is---Hey, Dad!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:09"><subtitle>
Why don't you tell Princess Carolynone of your great golf stories?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:12"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:44"><subtitle>
Wha-wha-wha-what?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:45"><subtitle>
The best way you can help usis to go back to your regular lifeand stay out of politics forever.</subtitle>

Hollyhock, you are never gonna hearfrom that guy again.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:10:37"><subtitle>
Okay, actually, I am,because when I left his dormhe said he would,and I quote, "Definitely text me."</subtitle>

Now, where was I?</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:10:59"><subtitle>
Right. You'll never everhear from this guy again.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:11:58"><subtitle>
You told me this was an interventionto get Todd to stop coming upwith awful ideas.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:02"><subtitle>
That was a pretenseto get you to show up.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:04"><subtitle>
-What?-It was Todd's idea.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:05"><subtitle>
What else you got, Todd?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:07"><subtitle>
Well, I got this one thing.I don't know. It might be pretty dumb.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:11"><subtitle>
-You bite your tongue.-Yes, bite it all the way off!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:13"><subtitle>
All your ideas are beyond terrible.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:16"><subtitle>
Well, in that case, I guess I must have"terrible" business instincts.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:19"><subtitle>
-You do!-Because I wanna hear it.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:12:21"><subtitle>
They say "the devil's in the details,"so let's summon the devil!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:24"><subtitle>
Okay, so you know how hard it is</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:26"><subtitle>
-to get your kids to go to the dentist?-I don't.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:28"><subtitle>
But what if dentistshad a friendlier face?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:31"><subtitle>
Ooh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:33"><subtitle>
What if you could take your kidsto a dentist's officewhere all the dentists were clowns?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:38"><subtitle>
-What?!-Kids love clowns!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:40"><subtitle>
-Do kids love clowns?-Actually--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:42"><subtitle>
Don't they?Who else would clowns be for?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:45"><subtitle>
Because adults don't love clowns.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:47"><subtitle>
That is true.Adults find clowns creepy and off-putting.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:49"><subtitle>
So kids must love clowns,because otherwise,why would there be clowns?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:55"><subtitle>
That is sound logic. Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:56"><subtitle>
I want these clown dentistslaughing maniacallyas they drill into the teethof America's children, starting yesterday!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:02"><subtitle>
As someone who does have children,I have to say,a lot of kidsare actually terrified of clowns!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:09"><subtitle>
Are they? Hm.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:10"><subtitle>
That would have been helpful informationbefore I committed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:13"><subtitle>
But my word is my bondand I already said yes, didn't I?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:16"><subtitle>
Okay, so do we find dentistsand train them to be clowns,or do we get clownsand train them to be dentists?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:22"><subtitle>
Why don't we get clowns and dentistsand they can train each other?</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:50"><subtitle>
What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:51"><subtitle>
No, I just mean that...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:53"><subtitle>
What, you thinkI'm not attractive enough for him?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:55"><subtitle>
Well, you're the onewho said you were a blob.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:58"><subtitle>
-Do you think I'm a blob?-No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:00"><subtitle>
What kind of personcalls his own daughter a blob?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:03"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:05"><subtitle>
Do you think I'm a blob?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:07"><subtitle>
I just-- <description>sighs</description></subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:16:08"><subtitle>
I just think L.A. is a superficial townand you need to be careful.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:16:15"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:17"><subtitle>
Hollyhock, wait. Wait. Wait!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:20"><subtitle>
I get it! It's my weight!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:28"><subtitle>
Yeah... I'm sorry about all that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:31"><subtitle>
Why didn't you tell me they hate cats?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:32"><subtitle>
They don't hate cats.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:33"><subtitle>
Now I get why you didn't wantto tell your family about the baby.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:36"><subtitle>
Okay, I was a little nervous.But they'll come around.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:38"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:50"><subtitle>
Can't believe she's still pissed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:51"><subtitle>
You shouldn't have called her a "blob."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:53"><subtitle>
I'm a blob too! We're both blobs!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:56"><subtitle>
How about just as a general rule,don't ever call a woman a blob?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:59"><subtitle>
Never! What if I meet a womanwhose name is Barbara Lob?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:03"><subtitle>
And I call her "B" for short. "B. Lob."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:05"><subtitle>
Maybe instead of figuring outthe woman blob workaround,you should just tell Hollyhockyou're sorry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:10"><subtitle>
I still think Miles is up to something.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:12"><subtitle>
Why is it so hard for you to believesomeone could genuinelylike your daughter?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:15"><subtitle>
Because she's like me!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:17"><subtitle>
Okay. Do you think maybe this could bemore about you than it is about her?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:22"><subtitle>
Yes, obviously, I have a lot of workto do on myself. Everyone knows that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:25"><subtitle>
But the important thing right nowis how I can fix things with Hollyhock.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:28"><subtitle>
Try to stay on topic, Diane.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:30"><subtitle>
Well, an open conversationabout your concerns with--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:33"><subtitle>
No, that's too Diane-y.She'd never buy it was coming from me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:35"><subtitle>
Then why do you want my advice?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:37"><subtitle>
I got it. If I can somehow prove to herwhat a jerk Miles is,then she'll have to like me moreby default.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:42"><subtitle>
That's the BoJack way.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:43"><subtitle>
BoJack, no--!Oh-- oh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:46"><subtitle>
Ooh, that's... that's nice.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:48"><subtitle>
Goldie, how would you liketo advance to the final round?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:50"><subtitle>
I would do anything, and I mean, anything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:55"><subtitle>
-So I did it. I had sex with the PA.-You had sex with him?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:59"><subtitle>
That's what you wanted, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:00"><subtitle>
I just said "seduce" the PA.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:03"><subtitle>
Doesn't that mean have sex with him?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:04"><subtitle>
No, I just wanted you to,like, get him all hot and bothered.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:08"><subtitle>
-Eh...?-And ready to sleep with you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:10"><subtitle>
Then once you get him on audiotape</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:12"><subtitle>
-saying that he would sleep with you...-What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:14"><subtitle>
...come up with some excuse to getout of there with virtue intact.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:16"><subtitle>
That's a lot of specificsyou just assumed I would know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:19"><subtitle>
Okay, well, the important thing is,we got him now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:23"><subtitle>
Tell Miles what you told me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:25"><subtitle>
-I had sex with the PA.-What PA?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:27"><subtitle>
I think his name was "Eggberg"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:30"><subtitle>
-What? Not him?-That's the intern.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:32"><subtitle>
-You said "PA."-Did you think I was a PA? Nice!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:35"><subtitle>
Why'd you want her to sleep with me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:37"><subtitle>
Not sleep with.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:39"><subtitle>
You told a contestantyou would advance her to the final roundif she slept with a PA?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:44"><subtitle>
I said "seduce." There is a distinction.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:46"><subtitle>
We make a show about empowering womenand lifting them up,and you cheapen itwith this coarse vulgarity.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:52"><subtitle>
I cannot lie. You disgust me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:54"><subtitle>
This was all a big misunderstanding.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:56"><subtitle>
Cover up your bottom and go, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:58"><subtitle>
You're not fit to judgeanyone's character, or their booties.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:04"><subtitle>
So it is about judging booties.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:07"><subtitle>
<description>groans</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:07"><subtitle>
-Hey, BoJack.-Miles.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:09"><subtitle>
Don't want me dating your daughter,you could have told me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:11"><subtitle>
I'm sorry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:12"><subtitle>
Maybe we could've worked outsome sort of deal.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:15"><subtitle>
What do you mean?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:16"><subtitle>
All right, so I got this screenplay,and I think it's a really fresh area.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:19"><subtitle>
It's about a production internwho wants to be a writer.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:22"><subtitle>
Oh, wow.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:23"><subtitle>
I think it could go somewhereif it got in front of the right person.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:26"><subtitle>
So if you have like an agentor a manager you could give it to,that would be awesome,and I would never talk to Hollyhock again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:31"><subtitle>
I promise.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:35"><subtitle>
So you were right. He was a dirtbag.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:39"><subtitle>
Yeah. I was kinda hopingI was wrong for once.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:41"><subtitle>
If it makes you feel any better,you were wrongabout all the other parts of this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:45"><subtitle>
Diane, you are so badat making people feel better.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:48"><subtitle>
Are you gonna tell Hollyhock?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:49"><subtitle>
She's a smart girl.She'll figure it out eventually.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:53"><subtitle>
But for now, if she believes someonecan love her for who she really is,then why would I take thataway from her?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:58"><subtitle>
BoJack, you gotta getone of these massages.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:54"><subtitle>
Don't be ridiculous, Diane.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:56"><subtitle>
They're not all dentist clowns.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:57"><subtitle>
Half of them are clown dentists.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:59"><subtitle>
Just try to ignore themand go about your business.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:02"><subtitle>
-Okay.-So, this is the incisor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:04"><subtitle>

just yesterday,Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:17"><subtitle>
seemed to be unbeatable,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:18"><subtitle>
but as a new candidate enters the race,is Woodchuck also "unbeata-Biel"?</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:21:31"><subtitle>
I'm tired of these politicianswho are all talk.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:33"><subtitle>
California needs a leaderwho excels in both comedy and drama</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:37"><subtitle>
and who is beautifulin an approachable girl-next-door way,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:39"><subtitle>
and who will get all the criminalsoff the street</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:41"><subtitle>
while simultaneously finding a usefor our wetlands.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:44"><subtitle>
That's why I'm running for governor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:46"><subtitle>
A candidate you can Jessica-lieve in.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:48"><subtitle>
What the--?!</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:53"><subtitle>
-Gadzooks!-Not now, Professor Flim-Flam!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:56"><subtitle>
Of course,Katrina would latch onto Jessicaas the beautiful faceof her dangerous agenda.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:00"><subtitle>
Well, there's no waythey could beat Woodchuck, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:03"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:07"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:10"><subtitle>
Woodchuck has no ideawhat he's up against.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:12"><subtitle>
You're right! But are we surethis is the right thing for us?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:15"><subtitle>
If I jump right back into politics,that's not gonna give me a lot of timeto focus on our burgeoningclown dentistry business.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:20"><subtitle>
<description>nose beeps</description></subtitle>

You need me, Woodchuck!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:46"><subtitle>
You've got brain smarts,but your sober-minded policy speechesare no match for the glitz and pizzazzof a Hollywoo starlet.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:53"><subtitle>
Even a relatively low-wattage onelike Jessica Biel.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:55"><subtitle>
He's right. California loves makingmovie stars governors.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:58"><subtitle>

I might have scared him off. I don't know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:57"><subtitle>
Do you ever get that feeling that like,to know you more is to love you less?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:03"><subtitle>
Hollyhock, you are an amazing womanand you should never settle for someonewho only loves the idea of you.</subtitle>
