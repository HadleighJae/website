<description>Ruthie</description> Princess Carolyn started her daywith a call to BoJack Horseman,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:52"><subtitle>
her former client-slash-lover.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:58"><subtitle>
<description>BoJack</description> Go for BoJack!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:59"><subtitle>
You like that?I'm trying out some new phone stuff.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:02"><subtitle>
Or is "Bo for GoJack" better?Nah, maybe too clever.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:05"><subtitle>
I don't want people to think I'm trying.Sorry, who is this?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:07"><subtitle>
Princess Carolyn, moron.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:09"><subtitle>
-Oh, hey, P.C. So what do you think?-About what?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:13"><subtitle>
"Go for BoJack!" Or maybe--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:14"><subtitle>
Ugh, stop!You need to get a new agent.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:17"><subtitle>
I'm sick of fielding your offers.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:18"><subtitle>
Offers? Well, you tell themthat I am not doing another reality show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:21"><subtitle>
So degrading.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:22"><subtitle>
All they had at craft serviceswas Kirkland snacks, P.C. Kirkland snacks.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:26"><subtitle>
Well, first of all, I don't work for you,so I'm not gonna tell anyone anything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:29"><subtitle>
But, second,these are actually good offers.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:31"><subtitle>
-Really? Like what?-I'm not telling you because--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:34"><subtitle>
Got it. Busy, busy. I'm busy too,so I'll call you back later. Bye.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:36"><subtitle>
-Don't call. I don't work for you!-How's this for a headline for the blog?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:39"><subtitle>
You write about this, quote,"BoJack Finally Solves Mystery</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:42"><subtitle>
of Hollyhock's Mother,comma, Looks Handsome,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:45"><subtitle>
colon: Is Cool." End quote.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:47"><subtitle>
I still don't understand your plan,or how that's a headline.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:50"><subtitle>
The plan couldn't be simpler.Go to the county courthouse,ask to see all the birth certificateson file, find Hollyhock's,see what it says in the "mother" spot.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:56"><subtitle>
They're not just gonna give youthe birth certificates.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:58"><subtitle>
Well, I gotta try something.I have this girl at my house</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:01"><subtitle>
who came to me for help,I want to do right by her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:03"><subtitle>
I just don't knowif you've thought through--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:05"><subtitle>
Diane, I am a famous.They will give me the birth certificate.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:08"><subtitle>
Everyone gives me everything I wantall the time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:11"><subtitle>
It is an existential curse,but a huge day-to-day convenience.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:15"><subtitle>
-So why do you need me?-I don't know. Just wanted some company.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:17"><subtitle>
You told me to use a vacation daybecause this was, quote,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:20"><subtitle>
"a feminism-related emergency."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:22"><subtitle>
-I got your number!-Why didn't you just bring Hollyhock?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:24"><subtitle>
I was gonna, but she got reallyinto counting her teeth this morning,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:27"><subtitle>
didn't want to leave the house.You know how teens are.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:29"><subtitle>
Ruthie, this was supposed to beabout your ancestor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:33"><subtitle>
-Who are all these other "chara-ca-ters"?-They fill out the world.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:37"><subtitle>
Well, can you tryto keep things focused, please?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:39"><subtitle>
Okay, okay, okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:40"><subtitle>
<description>Ruthie</description> Princess Carolyn had beencalled to Gekko-Rabitowitz--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:43"><subtitle>
the agency of her nemesis,and nemesis-slash-former lover.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:47"><subtitle>
-Ruthie!-Sorry, Teach-Bot.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:48"><subtitle>
She had a lot of former lovers.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:50"><subtitle>
She was a fluid sexual being,not a machine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:52"><subtitle>
<description>Ruthie</description>But today was all about business.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:54"><subtitle>
She was there because she was trying</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:56"><subtitle>
to get her clientCourtney Portnoy cast in--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:58"><subtitle>
Corpse Me If You Can-Can, the 1940'sCannes, France-set storyof a can-can dancer who contracts cancerbut continues to can-canas a canny cadaverwho plays the accordionwith Kevin Corrigan, Kevin Kline,</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:05:12"><subtitle>
-Got it.-<description>gasps</description> Gekko.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:14"><subtitle>
Princess Carolyn, hi! Love the dress.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:18"><subtitle>
Is it new, or something I've seen you wearliterally hundreds of times?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:21"><subtitle>
<description>Ruthie</description> Normally, Princess Carolynwould've been rattled,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:23"><subtitle>
but that day, she realized Vanessa Gekkono longer had any power over her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:27"><subtitle>
In truth, the woman had challengedand inspired Princess Carolyn,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:31"><subtitle>
not only to be a better agent,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:33"><subtitle>
but to be brave enoughto try and have it all.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:36"><subtitle>
Princess Carolyn wanted to tell herthank you, but instead she said...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:40"><subtitle>
-You look tired, "Veronica."-Oh, I--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:43"><subtitle>
Amazing burn, Princess Carolyn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:45"><subtitle>
Hey, Princess. We have a little snag.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:49"><subtitle>
Did Chris Kattan drop out?Right before his comeback?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:52"><subtitle>
Right when the world is finally readyto settle for Kattan?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:55"><subtitle>
-No, it's---You're fired.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:57"><subtitle>
I'm fired?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:59"><subtitle>
I tried to talk her out of it,but between the gun movie misfiringand her nuptialsturning into "nope-tials,"and her blaming youfor both of those things...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:06"><subtitle>
Who knew Portnoy had so many complaints?Oh, just give me one more chance.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:10"><subtitle>
I promise I can get you the leadin that can-can cadaver movie.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:13"><subtitle>
<description>laughs</description> What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:15"><subtitle>
Oh, P.C., C.P. just madethat whole thing up to get you here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:20"><subtitle>
You thought that was real?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:21"><subtitle>
The 1940's corpse who learns accordion?It sounds so ludicrous.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:26"><subtitle>
You did play the short-sighted seamstressin The Storm on Northern Fortress.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:30"><subtitle>
Well, yeah, but that was just becauseI wanted to work with Ashton.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:33"><subtitle>
We'll talk later, right?I'm so sorry. Bye.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:36"><subtitle>
Did you have a good meeting?<description>mockingly</description> Did you get fired?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:40"><subtitle>
<description>groans</description> Aw.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:44"><subtitle>
Sorry you got fired. Here's a latte.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:46"><subtitle>
Oh, uh--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:47"><subtitle>
-It's decaf, ma'am.-Thanks, Judah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:49"><subtitle>
You know, one year ago,a setback like thiswould have really spun me out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:53"><subtitle>
But I don't need Courtney.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:54"><subtitle>
Every time we fall, we get back upstronger and better than ever.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:58"><subtitle>
-Can I get a hallelujah?-Is that a sort of pressed juice?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:01"><subtitle>
I'll have one hallelujahon your desk by 12:45.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:03"><subtitle>
Great. What's next?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:04"><subtitle>
I noticed your necklace was broken,so I pushed back your appointment,and found a reputable jeweler nearby.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:08"><subtitle>
Don't know what I'd do without you,my hairy number two!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:11"><subtitle>
Oh, God, I'm sorry.That came out horribly.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:13"><subtitle>
Not to speak above my station,but perhaps it would behoove us to enticeBoJack Horseman back into our stable.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:18"><subtitle>
-Ugh!-I'm sorry, ma'am.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:19"><subtitle>
"Stable" and "behoove"were poor word choices.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:21"><subtitle>
I was not trying to engage in punneryduring business hours,but we've received 15 more inquiriesabout BoJack just this morning,and I don't think it's wise to looka gift... opportunity in the mouth.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:31"><subtitle>
BoJack is off the table.We're a small management company.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:35"><subtitle>
We just need to focuson the clients we have.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:37"><subtitle>
<description>Judah</description> You know best.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:43"><subtitle>
-<description>beeps</description>-Mo for Gister Peanutbutter!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:45"><subtitle>
Hey, handsome. Heard you dropped outof the governor's race.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:48"><subtitle>
Now let's get you back to workon what really matters-- show business!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:51"><subtitle>
-I'm going to stop you right there.-I was done.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:53"><subtitle>
Can't wait to get backin front of the camera,but right now, I have to help my formerpolitical rival defeat my two ex-wives.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:00"><subtitle>
One of whom is in the pocketof powerful lobbyistsand the other of whommurdered popular actorand soundtrack artisan, Zach Braff,and ate his burnt flesh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:06"><subtitle>
Politics as usual, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:08"><subtitle>
Well, when you're ready to work again--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:10"><subtitle>
Gotta go. They need all hands on deck,because Woodchucklost his hands undergroundand they replaced themwith creepy lobster claws.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:16"><subtitle>
Typical politics!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:22"><subtitle>
Hey. So I need this clasp replaced,24-karat gold.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:25"><subtitle>
This is a priceless family heirloom.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:28"><subtitle>
Princess Carolyn had gotten her necklacefrom her mother,who got it from her mother,who brought it from the old country.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:34"><subtitle>
When our ancestors first emigratedto America, they were very poor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:37"><subtitle>
Back in the Motherland,they had been doctors and engineers,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:41"><subtitle>
but here, they struggled to find work.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:43"><subtitle>
Every night, they would sing the songof the old country,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:46"><subtitle>
hoping to reclaim the glory of those days.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:48"><subtitle>

<description>Ruthie</description> They slowly soldall their belongings</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:57"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:07"><subtitle>
<description>Ruthie</description>But she never sold that necklace,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:10"><subtitle>
because that was the one giftshe could give her daughter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:12"><subtitle>
A treasure from the pastand a symbol of the tenacityand stick-to-itivenessthat has for generations led my familyto always land on their feet.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:23"><subtitle>
-You can come back in about two hours.-Thank you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:25"><subtitle>
-<description>clatters</description>-Sorry, sorry! Wait. Sorry, sorry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:28"><subtitle>
-<description>clatters</description>-Okay, okay, okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:30"><subtitle>
I'm just lookingfor something really nice.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:33"><subtitle>
This is for a sexy catfishI met on the Internet.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:36"><subtitle>
-Charley?-Princess Carolyn!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:39"><subtitle>
-You work at a jewelry store now?-No, I own my own management company.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:43"><subtitle>
Oh, yeah. Good for you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:44"><subtitle>
I'm so proud of you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:46"><subtitle>
Your approval means nothing to me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:48"><subtitle>
So I guess it's good you said "no"to my offer last year.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:51"><subtitle>
What offer? I mean, exactly what offerare you talking about?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:54"><subtitle>
I get so many.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:56"><subtitle>
Last year, I reached out to your guy...I wanna say, "Ju-do"...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:01"><subtitle>
-Judah.-This guy's name was Judo.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:04"><subtitle>
I offered to buy VIMand merge it with Vigor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:07"><subtitle>
We would have calledthe new company, VIMgor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:10"><subtitle>
Oh, right. That offer.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:13"><subtitle>
I couldn't believewhen he said you weren't interested.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:15"><subtitle>
Well, yeah. Because I wasn't,and he does what I say.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:18"><subtitle>
So I guess it all worked out for everyone.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:21"><subtitle>
You got to start over as a manager,and instead of buying VIM,I bought the Utah Jazz.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:26"><subtitle>
They're terrible agents,but they're getting better.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:29"><subtitle>
-Yeah.-Anyway, nice bumping into--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:31"><subtitle>
-Oh, sorry.-Careful, please. Ooh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:32"><subtitle>
-<description>Charley</description> Oopsie. Oh, boy.-No, no.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:34"><subtitle>
-<description>crashes</description>-Is that valuable? It is.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:36"><subtitle>
My great, great, great grandmotherwas dismayed that her trusted colleaguehad kept this from her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:40"><subtitle>
Her mind raced,"Was Judah capable of deception?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:43"><subtitle>
She hoped what Charley told herwasn't true,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:46"><subtitle>
but her instincts told herthe frog wasn't smart enough to lie.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:49"><subtitle>
First quarter, second quarter.Wow, that's a lot of quarters.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:52"><subtitle>
Oh, excuse me. Hello.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:54"><subtitle>
Judah, you'll never guesswho I just ran into.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:57"><subtitle>
No, I won't. Very astute, ma'am.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:59"><subtitle>
-It was Charley Witherspoon!-Mm-hmm.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:02"><subtitle>
-Char... ley...-Hmm...? Hmm!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:05"><subtitle>
-Wither... spoon!-Hmm.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:07"><subtitle>
-Okay.-How does that make you feel?</subtitle>
</timestamp>

That very short storymakes me feel nothing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

I don't think it's your faultas a storyteller.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:11:18"><subtitle>
Could it all have been a misunderstanding</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:20"><subtitle>
involving an enigmatic strangernamed "Judo"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:22"><subtitle>
So, what's next, then?</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:11:25"><subtitle>
Ooh, I want to get the life rightsto that woman I saw on Instagramwho had a pretty coffee.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:29"><subtitle>
I bet we could attach Jessica Albaand Jonathan Taylor-Thomas by lunch.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:34"><subtitle>
Okay, but I still don't understandwhat a manager is.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:37"><subtitle>
Do they just say the namesof movies and actors?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:39"><subtitle>
How does that generate revenue?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:41"><subtitle>
No one knows, Torf. It's not important!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:43"><subtitle>
Be quiet, Torf. Take your Hush Pill.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:55"><subtitle>
But is it possible you've forgottenyour doctor's appointment?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:58"><subtitle>
-Oh, fish!-It's my fault.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:00"><subtitle>
I rescheduled it in an attemptto make your life easier.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:02"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:12:15"><subtitle>
I know. Let's just go home.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:16"><subtitle>
No, Diane.How could you even suggest that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:18"><subtitle>
This is not about us.This is for my daughter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:20"><subtitle>
-Ugh.-I know what I have to do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:22"><subtitle>
Excuse me, excuse me. Pardon me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:23"><subtitle>
Important celebrity doing the right thing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:25"><subtitle>
-Whoa, a famous guy!-And he's doing the right thing?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:29"><subtitle>
This is like when George Clooneymarried that less famous lady!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:33"><subtitle>
-Wait. Don't you mean Jurj Clooners?-Who cares?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:36"><subtitle>

I recognize youfrom your Girl Croosh avatar.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:57"><subtitle>
I loved "Twenty Reasonsto Try the Diva Cup."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:00"><subtitle>
Oh, wow, thanks! You didn't think20 was too many reasons?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:04"><subtitle>
-No way. Number 14 blew my mind!-Didn't I say it would?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:08"><subtitle>
We don't have time.Where do we get a number?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:10"><subtitle>
-That line.-What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:11"><subtitle>
And you'll need these-- <description>grunts</description>forms.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:14"><subtitle>
Ow, paper cut! Who still uses paper?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:16"><subtitle>
Can't I just swipe an app or something?</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:21"><subtitle>

-<description>sighs</description>-<description>door opens</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:28"><subtitle>
-So? What's the prognosis?-Hmm...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:31"><subtitle>
I'm trying to think of the best wayto put this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:34"><subtitle>
As Charles Lindbergh would say,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:36"><subtitle>
"Sometimes you fly an airplane,and sometimes you lose a baby."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:39"><subtitle>
In this case, you didn't fly the airplane.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:41"><subtitle>
Wait, what?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:42"><subtitle>
Your pregnancy is no longer viable.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:45"><subtitle>
Well, how do we make it viable again?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:48"><subtitle>
Mm-mm...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:49"><subtitle>
How did this happen?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:50"><subtitle>
Goodness, I don't know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:51"><subtitle>
I wouldn't beat yourself up.Miscarriages happen for so many reasons.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:55"><subtitle>
There's nothing medically wrong with you.Maybe you just wanted the baby too much.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:59"><subtitle>
Maybe you didn't deserve itbecause you were unkind once.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:01"><subtitle>
Maybe you ran afoul of a trickster godor wood nymph who is now exacting revenge.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:05"><subtitle>
Oof!This is... a lot.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:08"><subtitle>
Not for me. This is my job,so... pretty regular day.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:11"><subtitle>
What do I do next?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:13"><subtitle>
Well, there's a procedure.We can do it here later this week.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:15"><subtitle>
You want Darlene to call someoneto drive you home?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:17"><subtitle>
No, I'm okay. I don't need anyone.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:20"><subtitle>
You're a real tough broad.Except for, you know, the uterus area.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:24"><subtitle>
Pretty weak.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:28"><subtitle>
<description>gasps</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:30"><subtitle>
-Hey, is my necklace ready?-Oh, I was going to call you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:33"><subtitle>
When I was working on your necklace,I realized something.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:36"><subtitle>
-Oh?-It's not actually gold,it's just gold plated. See?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:40"><subtitle>
No, it's very expensive.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:43"><subtitle>
It's pretty, but basically worthless.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:45"><subtitle>
And I'm only saying it's prettyto make you feel better.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:47"><subtitle>
But, it's from the old country.It's been in my family for generations.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:52"><subtitle>
No, this is costume jewelryfrom J.C. Penney.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:55"><subtitle>
Circa 1963.Somebody just told you a story.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:59"><subtitle>
-I'm sorry.-Wha-- huh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:01"><subtitle>
So, do you still want a 24-karat goldclasp on this garbage necklace, or...?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:08"><subtitle>
<description>sniffles</description> Oh-hh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:12"><subtitle>
<description>gasps, sobs</description></subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:33"><subtitle>
The doctor's appointment got pushed back.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:36"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:41"><subtitle>
I like your perfume.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:43"><subtitle>
There is a painting of a lake on the wall.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:45"><subtitle>
You sure it's okay I'm not there with you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:47"><subtitle>
Ralph, it's fine. I'm a big girl.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:49"><subtitle>
Everything is so easy with you,Princess Carolyn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:51"><subtitle>
I mean, that's why I love you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:53"><subtitle>
Yeah, easy. <description>chuckles</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:55"><subtitle>
That's what the boys in high schoolliked about me, too.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:57"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description>Okay, I'll see you tonight.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:59"><subtitle>
-I love you.-I love you, too.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:01"><subtitle>
<description>beeps</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:02"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:06"><subtitle>
<description>slurps, moans</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:09"><subtitle>
Oh, I didn't realize you were still here.Do you need anything else before I go?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:12"><subtitle>
No. Thank you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:14"><subtitle>
Should you be drinking that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:16"><subtitle>
You don't always knowwhat's best for me, Judah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:18"><subtitle>
Is everything okay, Princess Carolyn?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:19"><subtitle>
Charley Witherspoonmade you an offer to buy Vim,and you went over my headand turned him down without telling me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:26"><subtitle>
Oh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:27"><subtitle>
-So it's true. You lied to me.-Yes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:30"><subtitle>
Because you didn't want to workat a big agency.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:32"><subtitle>
-You don't fit in with other people.-I--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:34"><subtitle>
You're weird, so you'd rather stay herewhere you have all the power.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:37"><subtitle>
No, Princess Carolyn--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:39"><subtitle>
So you lied to me,and you made me look like an idiot!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:41"><subtitle>
I was trying to protect you. If you heard,you'd feel like you had to say yes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:45"><subtitle>
I don't need you to protect me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:46"><subtitle>
If you had time, you could decidewhat to do nexton your own terms, which you did.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:50"><subtitle>
Well, that's not your decision to make.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:51"><subtitle>
Princess Carolyn,I understand you're upset.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:53"><subtitle>
-And perhaps your emotions---No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:55"><subtitle>
If I can't trust you,then I can't work with you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:57"><subtitle>
You're fired.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:00"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:03"><subtitle>
Thank you for my time here,Princess Carolyn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:04"><subtitle>
It's been very pleasurable. Until now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:07"><subtitle>
This part is... sad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:11"><subtitle>
Don't forget,you have reservations at 8:00.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:13"><subtitle>
-Thank you, Judah.-Good night.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:18"><subtitle>
Ruthie, this story has gotten really dark.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:21"><subtitle>
It has a happy ending. I promise.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:23"><subtitle>
Well, can we get there soon?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:24"><subtitle>
This assignmentwas supposed to be six beans long.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:28"><subtitle>
You've already gone on for eight beans.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:30"><subtitle>
Okay. I'm almost finished.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:31"><subtitle>
But first, let's check inwith BoJack and Diane again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:34"><subtitle>
What have they been up to?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:35"><subtitle>
<description>beeping</description>Error. Error.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:38"><subtitle>
I'm not leavingwithout the certificate!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:40"><subtitle>
I danced your dance, lady.I filled out that form.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:42"><subtitle>
But I will not wait in this line anymore.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:44"><subtitle>
Not one person in hereoffered me a Fiji water,and I am parchedfrom all the yelling I've been doing!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:50"><subtitle>
BoJack, let's go home.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:52"><subtitle>
No, I would like to registera formal complaint.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:55"><subtitle>
-How do I do that?-Complaints are on the eighth floor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:57"><subtitle>
But you need to fill out an applicationfor a complaint registration,which you can get by waitingin line 12-B on the third floor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:05"><subtitle>
You have won this round.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:08"><subtitle>
So Princess Carolyn had to meet Ralph.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:10"><subtitle>
But she didn't know how to tell himwhat had happened</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:12"><subtitle>
or how he'd take the news.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:15"><subtitle>
Okay, so, what do you thinkabout "National Paperweight Day"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:18"><subtitle>
"Thanks for keeping my papers in place.I love you as big as outer space."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:21"><subtitle>
Okay, so you'd give that cardto a paperweight?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:25"><subtitle>
Ah, Principessa! And Signor Stilton.Welcome-a back.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:29"><subtitle>
Let's have a drink then, yes?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:30"><subtitle>
I'll have a glassof Châteauneuf-du-Pape,the red wine inspired by Scandal.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:34"><subtitle>
That Kerry Washington has really broughtred wine into popularity.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:38"><subtitle>
It's a-funny,because I thought that the terroirof the Italian countryside did it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:42"><subtitle>
-But, a-no, it's-a Miss Kerry Washington.-Ugh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:46"><subtitle>
Everybody love-a Miss-a Kerry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:48"><subtitle>
And my gal pal herewould love some mint tea. Right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:51"><subtitle>
-You know it.-Bene, bene.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:53"><subtitle>
How was the doctor?He tell you the species?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:55"><subtitle>
I can't stop thinking about squeezinglittle Philbert's baby feet.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:58"><subtitle>
-Aw-ww...-<description>Ruthie</description> She wanted to tell him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:00"><subtitle>
But she also wanted to let him stayin his beautiful hopeful reality,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:04"><subtitle>
a reality she herself had lived injust hours before,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:08"><subtitle>
and to which she now longeddesperately to return.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:10"><subtitle>
Well, the doctor didn't have much info.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:13"><subtitle>
You know how doctors are. But he did saythere's nothing wrong with me, so--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:17"><subtitle>
-Ah, Miss-a Carrie Underwood.-Ooh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:19"><subtitle>
-Miss-a Carey Mulligan.-Agh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:21"><subtitle>
Miss-a Carey, first name Mariah,right this-a way!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:25"><subtitle>
-Ugh!-Look at all of these Miss-a-Carries!</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:29"><subtitle>
-I have to go.-Oh. Well, you want me to drive you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:31"><subtitle>
No, it's fine.I'll just meet you at home.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:34"><subtitle>

<description>Ruthie</description> But when Princess Carolyngot to the home that she and Ralph shared,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:39"><subtitle>
she found she didn't have the strengthto go inside.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:45"><subtitle>
She wanted to go some place familiar,some place that was just hers.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:51"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:01"><subtitle>
Only the future.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:03"><subtitle>
This is horrifyingand it doesn't look legal,whatever it is, you'd bettercut me in for ten percent.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

I could cut you off a lot more than that.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:55"><subtitle>
