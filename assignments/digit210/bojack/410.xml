</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:32"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:02:35"><subtitle>
it's "beclaws"of Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz.</subtitle>

<description>Tom Jumbo-Grumbo</description>Woodchuck is down in the polls.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:48"><subtitle>
Californians just aren't connectingwith his message.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:52"><subtitle>
I have a very importantpolicy announcement.</subtitle>

-I've got new hands, baby!-<description>crowd cheering</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:58"><subtitle>
Now Woodchuck is way up in the polls!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:00"><subtitle>
I guess his messagewas connecting with voters after all.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:05"><subtitle>
Hey! How you doin'?Looking good.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:07"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:14"><subtitle>
What's the big deal?I have hands too.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:16"><subtitle>
There's no way those new handsare as perfect as everyone says.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:18"><subtitle>
Nobody's hands are all the way clean.Computer, zoom in on that thumb.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:22"><subtitle>
And enhance. Zoom in again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:25"><subtitle>
Enhance again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:26"><subtitle>
Zoom in three more times.Enhance. Enhance.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:29"><subtitle>
Now zoom out once.De-enhance.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:31"><subtitle>
Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:32"><subtitle>
What are you doing?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:33"><subtitle>
Quiet, "Face.""Brain" is working on something.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:35"><subtitle>
Computer, take a scanon that thumbprint</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:38"><subtitle>
and cross-reference, please.</subtitle>

<description>printer whirring</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:41"><subtitle>
-Ha! Just what I expected.-What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:45"><subtitle>
Before Woodchuck,the hands belonged to one</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:48"><subtitle>
Ernest Contralto, a criminal.The man was a pedophile murderer.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:54"><subtitle>
Well, if you gotta murder somebody...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:56"><subtitle>
No, Tom. Not a pedophile-dash-murderer.A pedophile-slash-murderer!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:01"><subtitle>
Oh, no! The way you said "slash"was very scary!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:05"><subtitle>
At first I didn't like him,on account, uh... he didn't have hands?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:09"><subtitle>
But then he got new hands,so I liked him again?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:12"><subtitle>
But then I found out those hands are bad!Can't trust politicians.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:15"><subtitle>
She's killing us on this hands thing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:18"><subtitle>
Much like Ernest Contraltokilled those innocent children</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:20"><subtitle>
after he pedophiled them,with those very hands.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:23"><subtitle>
Not helping!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:24"><subtitle>
Your hands are beingreally aggressive right now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:27"><subtitle>
-<description>groans</description>-Watch out! They're attacking your face!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:33"><subtitle>
Hey, girl, whatcha working on?Getting some clicks?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:35"><subtitle>
Get them clicks, girl.Get. Them. Clicks.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:39"><subtitle>
I'm working on another big pieceabout how Jessica Biel is owned</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:43"><subtitle>
by private prison lobbyists, who want--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:44"><subtitle>
Oh, my Gaia, Diane, nobody cares.I care and I don't even care.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:49"><subtitle>
So imagine how littlesomeone who doesn't care cares.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:52"><subtitle>
-Well...-What if you had lunch with her?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:55"><subtitle>
-Why would---You could write about</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:56"><subtitle>
what she smells like,how she makes her face pretty.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:59"><subtitle>
These are things people will wantto know about our first female governor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:02"><subtitle>
Ugh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:05"><subtitle>
<description>screeching</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:08"><subtitle>
I'll have the avocado toast.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:09"><subtitle>
But instead of the avocado part,I want fresh sea air,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:13"><subtitle>
and instead of the toast,I'll have a single grain of rice.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:16"><subtitle>
-And for you?-Grilled cheese?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:19"><subtitle>
Thank you for meeting me here, Diane.I just wanted to tell you,you can keep writingwhatever you want about me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:24"><subtitle>
Obviously, it has no effect on the polls,because the only thing voters care aboutis stupid bullshit, so knock yourself out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:30"><subtitle>
Well, today I just want to knowwhat you smell like.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:33"><subtitle>
It's actually my new fragrance:"Bielist," by Jessica Biel.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:37"><subtitle>
-Your perfume's called "B"-list?-"Bielist."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:39"><subtitle>
"B"-list. Like a "B"-list celebrity.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:41"><subtitle>
-No, "Bielist" like Jessica Biel.-I think we're saying the same thing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:45"><subtitle>
Do you want some?I got a whole trunk of this stuff.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:47"><subtitle>
-No, thanks.-You sure?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:49"><subtitle>
Mr. Peanutbutter always lovedthe way I smelled.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:51"><subtitle>
Well, I wouldn't flatteryourself too much.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:53"><subtitle>
He's very enthusiasticabout smelling in general.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:56"><subtitle>
He's enthusiastic about everything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:58"><subtitle>
Oh, my God. Does he still havethat dumb magic eye poster?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:01"><subtitle>
What? No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:02"><subtitle>
When we were married,he was obsessed with it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:05"><subtitle>
And he would make mestare at it for hours.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:08"><subtitle>
Yeah, I bet.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:09"><subtitle>
But then, all of a sudden, I saw it.And it was incredible.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:13"><subtitle>
And I was so happythat I had waited long enoughto experience this beautiful thing,and I felt so...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:18"><subtitle>
Why is this disgusting avocadoon my plate?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:20"><subtitle>
-Oh, I...-I feel personally attacked right now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:22"><subtitle>
-Oh, so sorry.-<description>retches</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:24"><subtitle>
Anyway,as I was saying about the poster,it's funny how something so stupidcould have this tremendous power.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:30"><subtitle>
You know what I mean?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:32"><subtitle>
Yeah. I think I do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:35"><subtitle>
A blog post about Jessica Bielis gaining attention</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:38"><subtitle>
for the seemingly minor detail</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:40"><subtitle>
that the candidatewould not eat an avocado,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:42"><subtitle>
calling the savory fruit,quote, "disgusting."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:45"><subtitle>
Who doesn't like avocados?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:47"><subtitle>
I don't know if Jessica Bielhas the right judgment to lead California.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:51"><subtitle>
And I was totally convinced before,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:53"><subtitle>
-so it's really...-Whoa!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:54"><subtitle>
...the avocado thingthat I have a problem with.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:57"><subtitle>
Why would you saythat you hate avocados?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:00"><subtitle>
I just have to live my truth, Katrina.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:03"><subtitle>
<description>groaning</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:05"><subtitle>
Her polls,like an avocado exposed to air,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:08"><subtitle>
have quickly turned from a verdant greento a mushy brown.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:11"><subtitle>
And with only seven daysuntil the election,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:13"><subtitle>
her campaign might be in the pits.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:16"><subtitle>
Wow. Who'da thunkthat such a small trivial detailcould be the thing to take Biel down?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:20"><subtitle>
Yeah, who'da thunk it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:22"><subtitle>
Who knew?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:25"><subtitle>
I knew. I put the avocado thingin the story on purpose,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:27"><subtitle>
I knew people wouldn't like it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:28"><subtitle>
So just for the record, I "thunk" it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:30"><subtitle>
Even though it doesn't matter.I don't need credit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:32"><subtitle>
But it does, if I didn't do that,it wouldn't have happened.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:35"><subtitle>
So, it's because of me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:36"><subtitle>
-Well, whoever is responsible---Me. I just told you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:38"><subtitle>
We shouldn't get too excited just yet.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:40"><subtitle>
The election is a week away,and a lot can happen in a week.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:44"><subtitle>
This is far from over.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:47"><subtitle>
It's over. And the clear winneris Woodchuck Coodchuck-Berkowitz.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:52"><subtitle>
-All right!-Huzzah!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:53"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:02"><subtitle>
You and me, working together,both contributing the same amount.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:05"><subtitle>
Well, I wrote the articlethat got Woodchuck elected governor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:09"><subtitle>
You're the one that made himnot governor in the first place.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:11"><subtitle>
I set 'em up. You knock 'em down.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:16"><subtitle>
Thank you for meeting me here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:17"><subtitle>
My name is Yolanda Buenaventuraof the Better Business Bureau.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:20"><subtitle>
It would be funnierif your name was Betty Buenaventuraof the Better Business Bureau.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:25"><subtitle>
Well, I'm sorry you don't findmy name sufficiently comical,but this is actuallya very serious matter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:30"><subtitle>
-Oh.-We've received complaintsfrom several concerned parents.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:33"><subtitle>
It seems that manyof your clown dentistsaren't actually licensedto practice medicine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:37"><subtitle>
Isn't laughter the best medicine?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:40"><subtitle>
No. It is the worst medicine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:42"><subtitle>
If you can even call it medicine,which, legally, you cannot.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:44"><subtitle>
Well, what if I said my businesswas for entertainment purposes?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:48"><subtitle>
That would require your employeesto be entertaining.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:51"><subtitle>
According to your reviews on Yelp,your clown dentists are, quote,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:54"><subtitle>
"A cotton candy nightmare of Freudianinvention that shakes one to the core."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:58"><subtitle>
Ah, everyone's a critic.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:00"><subtitle>
On Yelp? Yes, that is the idea.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:02"><subtitle>
It appears your business providesno service but to terrify childrenand the adults who accompany them.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:06"><subtitle>
If this were October,you could market your ventureas some sort of spookyHalloween experience,but since this is January,a month which, to my knowledge,contains no Halloweens,I have no choice but to--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:16"><subtitle>
Wait! Wait.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:18"><subtitle>
What if my clown dentistsput on a show?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:20"><subtitle>
A delightful, whimsical,non-terrifying clown-stravaganza?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:26"><subtitle>
You would have to agreewe were a legitimatebusiness then, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:30"><subtitle>
-Go on.-Give us a week. We'll put on a show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:33"><subtitle>
If you don't laugh,I'll dissolve the businessand release all my clown dentistsinto the woods,where they'll never bother anyone again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:41"><subtitle>
All right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:42"><subtitle>
You have one week to create a showthat delights and astonishes me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:44"><subtitle>
But I should warn you,I am a very tough crowd.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:14"><subtitle>
"What's the differencebetween an agent and a manager?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:16"><subtitle>
Uh, managers are alwaystalking about the differencesbetween agents and managersand agents don't as much?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:22"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:14:02"><subtitle>
Now let's get to brass stacks.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:05"><subtitle>
So it's a hot young writer.It's TV. It's me producing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:09"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:10"><subtitle>
I know it's gonna knock your socks off.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:20"><subtitle>
Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:21"><subtitle>
They look to make a playin the gritty prestige streaming world,and it could make a big splashwith a huge ad buy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:26"><subtitle>
Plus, you got the built-in audiencewho don't know what time it is.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:28"><subtitle>
That's huge! That's so many people!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:31"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:14:38"><subtitle>
Philbert? Who's Philbert?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:40"><subtitle>
He's this grizzledbut very good-looking detectivewho gets sucked back in to something.</subtitle>

Tina is drawing so many cards.It's amazing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:48"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:18:51"><subtitle>
-<description>body thuds in distance</description>-Hollyhock?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:53"><subtitle>
<description>woman</description> That's her name?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:54"><subtitle>
Yes, for the third time,her name is "Hollyhock."</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:18:57"><subtitle>
Manheim-Mannheim, uh, Steamroller...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:01"><subtitle>
Is there more?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:02"><subtitle>
I think there's a Lopezin the mix somewhere?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:04"><subtitle>
A Chung maybe?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:06"><subtitle>
I'm sorry, sir, I can't help you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:08"><subtitle>
Okay, just... any informationyou can give meon the 17-year-old horse girlwho came here by ambulance</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:13"><subtitle>
15 minutes ago would beof interest to my friend,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:15"><subtitle>
Mr. Franklin's... friend, Mr. Hamilton.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:17"><subtitle>
If you can't prove you'reher parent or legal guardian,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:20"><subtitle>
I can't release any information to you.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:23"><subtitle>
Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero...Robinson...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:26"><subtitle>
Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzarelli-McQuack.That's her name.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:29"><subtitle>
And she's about five-eight.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:30"><subtitle>
And she's 17,her birthday is in September.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:32"><subtitle>
And... she looks like me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:34"><subtitle>
And she loves applesbut hates apple sauce.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:36"><subtitle>
And she's funny.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:38"><subtitle>
But she isn't mean.Which is pretty remarkable,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:41"><subtitle>
'cause a lot of 17-year-olds thinkyou have to be mean to be funny,but Hollyhock is very sweet,even if she can be sarcastic.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:48"><subtitle>
But she has this smile with...</subtitle>
