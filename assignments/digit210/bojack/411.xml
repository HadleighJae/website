I don't care if you're scaredof Clemelia Bloodsworth and her gaggle,you have to go to school.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:22"><subtitle>
Now stop making books your friends.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:24"><subtitle>
Reading does nothing for young womenbut build their brains,</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:03:27"><subtitle>
taking valuable resources awayfrom their breasts and hips.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:48"><subtitle>
and you are continually failing!</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:03:50"><subtitle>
How could you not have knownshe has scarlet fever?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:53"><subtitle>
Say something, damn it!What has become of you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:55"><subtitle>
I swear if I'd knownthis is how you'd behaveonce we severed the connectionsto your prefrontal cortex,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:01"><subtitle>
I'd hardly have bothered.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:02"><subtitle>
-Father?-<description>gasps</description> Yes, darling?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:05"><subtitle>
Am I to die?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:06"><subtitle>
Well, eventually yes,but this illness is but a hiccupin what will be a long and happy life,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:11"><subtitle>
-I promise.-You promise?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:12"><subtitle>
In fact, some goodmay yet come of this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:14"><subtitle>
Doctor says your throatis nearly swollen shut.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:17"><subtitle>
So perhaps you'll finally losesome of that weightthat's given you such troubles.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:20"><subtitle>
-Won't that be nice?-Yes, Father.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:26"><subtitle>
-Ow!-Suck in, Miss Sugarman, please.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:28"><subtitle>
Polly, be a darling and fetch mea pretty pilland a glass of water, won't you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:32"><subtitle>
Yes, Se√±orita Sugarman.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:34"><subtitle>
Beatrice, you're looking well,which is just fine,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:36"><subtitle>
because your debutante partyis vitally important.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:39"><subtitle>
Will it end poverty, war and injustice,or bring back civil rightsactivist Medgar Evers,who was shot in Mississippithis week?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:46"><subtitle>
Yes! Or rather, it will end youworrying about that nonsensebecause it will land you a husband.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:51"><subtitle>
At least Evers' death means no one elsewill be assassinated this year, 1963.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:57"><subtitle>
The FBI is on too high alert to allowanything like that to happen again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:01"><subtitle>
-Hmm?-Yes... well...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:03"><subtitle>
Your chaperone,Corbin Creamerman,is a fine young man.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:06"><subtitle>
Oh, jeez.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:08"><subtitle>
-My lady. <description>chuckles</description> Here you go.-Thanks.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:14"><subtitle>
So... uh, you look nice.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:18"><subtitle>
Thank you, Corbin.That's the third time you've told me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:21"><subtitle>
You needn't tell me again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:22"><subtitle>
Oh, jeez. I'm sorry.I'm not always good at these things.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:26"><subtitle>
But sometimes I am.I can be. I-- I really try to be.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:29"><subtitle>
I'm, well, I-- I'm not. I'm really not.I don't know why.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:32"><subtitle>
Ah, that's all right. I'm not either.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:35"><subtitle>
<description>Joseph</description>Corbin's father, Mort Creamerman,is founder of Creamerman'sCreamy Cream-based Commodities.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:40"><subtitle>
Think of all the free iced creamyou could, uh, serve to other people.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:44"><subtitle>
Father, do you aim to marry me offto Corbin Creamermanmerely because it would be goodfor business?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:49"><subtitle>
Well, I suppose I do have a few ideasof how a Sugarman/Creamermanalliance might be advantageous.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:54"><subtitle>
-Uh-huh.-For example,imagine a television advertisementwith a fun jingle.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:58"><subtitle>
<music> Have your morning coffee or tea </music></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:01"><subtitle>
<music> With Sugarman and Creamerman </music></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:03"><subtitle>
<music> But save some for... these fellas </music></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:05"><subtitle>
And then it's Mort and me,and we're holding up our productswith big smiles from acrossa very ordinary looking kitchen table.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:11"><subtitle>
Father, common Americansdon't want you on their TV sets.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:14"><subtitle>
You're a reminder of the disparityof wealth in this country.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:18"><subtitle>
Poor people find that dreadfully gauche.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:20"><subtitle>
You know, I sent you to Barnardto get your MRSfrom a fine upstanding Columbia man,but instead of a bacheloryou returned homewith a bachelor's degreeand a mouth full of sass.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:30"><subtitle>
What a waste!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:32"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:34"><subtitle>
-<description>Corbin</description> You look nice.-Thank you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:36"><subtitle>
Oh, my... Beatrice Sugarman?Doth my eye belie me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:41"><subtitle>
Oh, Clemelia Bloodsworth.Why are you here?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:45"><subtitle>
I must say,it's tremendous you're finally debuting.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:49"><subtitle>
Better late than never, hmm?<description>chuckles</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:51"><subtitle>
Ugh! I'm only doing this for my father,who has very old-fashioned ideasabout how a woman is to live her life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:57"><subtitle>
Poor Corbin here is saddledwith chaperoning me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:00"><subtitle>
Oh, I don't feel saddled.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:02"><subtitle>
In truth,I find these parties to be garish,self-serving wastes of money.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:06"><subtitle>
Oh, and I'm sure yourswas particularly horrendous, Clemelia.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:10"><subtitle>
<description>spits and coughs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:11"><subtitle>
Oh, my! How repugnant!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:17"><subtitle>
Uh... scotch on the rocks.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:21"><subtitle>
-Do I know you?-<description>chuckles</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:23"><subtitle>
Nope, just crashing some dumbdebutante's party. <description>chuckles</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:26"><subtitle>
Oh, do you mean for "dumb"to describe the party or the debutante?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:30"><subtitle>
Because I might agree with you,or I might be offended.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:33"><subtitle>
You're the dumb debutante, aren't you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:35"><subtitle>
Beatrice Sugarman.Welcome to my dumb party.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:38"><subtitle>
Butterscotch Horseman.Charmed, I'm sure.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:40"><subtitle>
You crash a lot of these?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:41"><subtitle>
I'll take my free alcoholwhere I can get it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:43"><subtitle>
Saving for California.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:45"><subtitle>
What's in California?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:46"><subtitle>
Ginsberg, Cassady, Squirrelinghetti.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:48"><subtitle>
This is where you ask meif those are towns, and I smirk at you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:51"><subtitle>
I am familiar with the Beats,thank you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:53"><subtitle>
I like Ginsberg all right,but if you ask me,that Squirrelinghetti is nuts.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:58"><subtitle>
-What's your interest in them?-What's my interest?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:00"><subtitle>
They're the greatest mindsof our generation.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:02"><subtitle>
I'm heading west to join them,because I'm one of the greatest minds too.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:06"><subtitle>
-I see.-You will see.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:07"><subtitle>
I'm writing the nextGreat American Novel.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:09"><subtitle>
Oh, what's it about?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:11"><subtitle>
It's about truth! It's about war!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:13"><subtitle>
It's about the twilighting frontierof the lives that were promised us.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:16"><subtitle>
But what is it about?Who are the characters?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:19"><subtitle>
I never claimed to havethe whole thingsorted out just yet, did I?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:22"><subtitle>
Sounds like a best seller.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:23"><subtitle>
You're sarcastic, which is an ugly thingfor a woman to be.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:26"><subtitle>
I don't know how you expectto nab a husband at a party like thiswith a personality like that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:30"><subtitle>
Oh, congratulations. You and my fatherexpress the same concerns.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:34"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description> If I were your old man,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:36"><subtitle>
I'd be anxiousto get you married off, too.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:38"><subtitle>
I bet your thank-you lettersare perfunctory,your flower arrangementsare uninspired,and your curtsy is an embarrassment.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:45"><subtitle>
-<description>chuckles</description>-<description>laughs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>

<timestamp time="00:08:50"><subtitle>
What must your mother think of you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:52"><subtitle>
Oh, she doesn't think much...about anything, anymore.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:55"><subtitle>
Oh. I'm sorry, did... did she pass?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:57"><subtitle>
-No, not exactly.-Mine did.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:00"><subtitle>
I'm very sorry to hear that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:02"><subtitle>
I was little. I don't remember, really.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:04"><subtitle>
But she had a diamond just like yours.I saw it in a picture once.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:08"><subtitle>
Oh...</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:09:09"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:11"><subtitle>
I'd like to leave her here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:12"><subtitle>
Can I pay for the next five years nowso I don't have to think about her again?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:16"><subtitle>
-Wha-- Oh.-<description>Corbin</description> Oh, jeez, I--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:17"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:06"><subtitle>
Why don't you come with me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:07"><subtitle>
It'll dispense with the need for goodbyes,thus eliminating my transgression.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:10:44"><subtitle>
After the disappearing act you pulledat your own party,you're lucky I don't fill a jarwith jellied beansand marry you off to the manwho can closest estimate the amount.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:11:00"><subtitle>
And the way they makenon-dairy creameris by replacing the milk fatwith vegetable oil.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:06"><subtitle>
That's why it doesn't need refrigeration.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:08"><subtitle>
-Pretty nifty, huh?-Is that so?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:11"><subtitle>
-Oh, jeez, I'm boring you.-Not at all. I don't find you boring.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:11:14"><subtitle>
Only the things you chooseto talk about,and the way in whichyou talk about them.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:18"><subtitle>
Oh, I... I'm sorry. I...I just get excited by food chemistry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:22"><subtitle>
You know, you take somethingyou thought you knew,and then discoverthere's so much more to itthan you could have possibly imagined.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:27"><subtitle>
-It's like... magic.-Oh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:30"><subtitle>
My father is less enchanted.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:32"><subtitle>
He says it's just squeezing moneyout of cow teats.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:35"><subtitle>
I suppose that's true,but I got ideas too,and I feel I never get to be anythingother than what he expects me to be.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
