<timestamp time="00:00:06"><subtitle>
<description>Princess Carolyn</description> I got intothis business because I love stories.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:09"><subtitle>
They comfort us, they inspire us,they create a contextfor how we experience the world.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:14"><subtitle>
But also, you have to be careful,because if you spenda lot of time with stories,you start to believe that lifeis just stories, and it's not.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:22"><subtitle>
Life is life, and that's so sad,because there's so little time and...what are we doing with it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:30"><subtitle>
-<description>clocks ticking</description>-Thank you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:33"><subtitle>
When Princess Carolyn told mewe were pitchingto whattimeisitrightnow.com,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:37"><subtitle>
I was excited,because in so many ways,the story I'm about to tell is about time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:43"><subtitle>
And it's about time this story was told.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:46"><subtitle>

<description>Flip</description> But now he finds himselfin a new time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:58"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:03"><subtitle>
Oh, so it's not like a time full of newts?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:06"><subtitle>
No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:07"><subtitle>
Unless you want it to bea time full of newts.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:09"><subtitle>
-No, no, no, no. I'm just clarifying.-Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:12"><subtitle>
He finds himself in a timehe doesn't understand.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:17"><subtitle>
-<description>sighs</description>-<description>phone dialing</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:20"><subtitle>
-<description>man</description> Don't call this number again.-Wait. I-- I just--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:22"><subtitle>
My mother, she's senile,and she was drugging the coffee.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:25"><subtitle>
That's why-- Just--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:26"><subtitle>
I wanted you to know thatnone of this was Hollyhock's fault.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:29"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:30"><subtitle>
<description>Flip</description> A time in which he is alone.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:34"><subtitle>
Perhaps, all this time,he's been alone.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:38"><subtitle>
-Except for the newts, right?-Hmm.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:41"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:54"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:00"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:02"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:05"><subtitle>
-Well---Oh, he's definitely attached.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:08"><subtitle>
He signed a contract. I saw it myself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:11"><subtitle>
Oh, right. Yeah, yeah.<description>gulps</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>

<timestamp time="00:05:29"><subtitle>
<description>Scheck</description> Well, sometimes,DNA can be a tricky thing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:32"><subtitle>
Like, for example,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:33"><subtitle>
was Simpson DNA found at the sceneof the murder of Nicole Brown?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:37"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:41"><subtitle>
-Who's to say?-Oh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:42"><subtitle>
Maybe it was some other Simpson,like his son, or his father.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:46"><subtitle>
There's no way to know.I wouldn't worry about it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:49"><subtitle>
That's too much, man--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:56"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:04"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:06"><subtitle>
-Good thinking.-Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:07"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:10"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:43"><subtitle>
There goes my reputation, my career--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:45"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:06:57"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:04"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:05"><subtitle>
Look, the woods are dark and scary,but the only way out is through.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:14"><subtitle>
-Um, what were we talking about?-No, you're right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:17"><subtitle>
The only way out is through.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:19"><subtitle>
I gotta talk to BoJack.I gotta stop feeling sorry for myself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:22"><subtitle>
I'm Princess Carolyn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:24"><subtitle>
That's the spirit!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:25"><subtitle>
As my blood type always says,"B" positive!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:29"><subtitle>
-What was that?-I don't know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:30"><subtitle>
-Oh!-Oh!</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:48"><subtitle>
And then he started biting everyone,and now a bunch of them have rabies.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:52"><subtitle>
Who could have predictedmy innocent clown dentist venture</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:55"><subtitle>
-could turn into something so terrifying?-I don't see how this concerns me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:59"><subtitle>
Yolanda, the only reasonthey're in the woods at allis because of you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:03"><subtitle>
If people find out the BetterBusiness Bureau is behind this,you don't think you'll be getting a buzzfrom the Business Branchof the Board of Better Bureaus?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:11"><subtitle>
You're right! We have to do somethingbefore someone gets hurt.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:14"><subtitle>
Call me four out of five dentists,because I agree.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:18"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:27"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:30"><subtitle>
Yeah! When's the last timewe did something impulsive?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:32"><subtitle>
Well, you did run for governorwithout giving it much--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:35"><subtitle>
I just think we could use a vacation.Things have been so crazy this last year.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:38"><subtitle>
Before we start the rest of our lives,haven't we earned a break?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:41"><subtitle>
All right. Let's go to Hawaii! They gotthat bridge that's just sitting there.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:45"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:48"><subtitle>
-All right! Hawaii!-Hawaii!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:51"><subtitle>
-<description>horns honking</description>-<description>Diane</description> Oh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:54"><subtitle>
-<description>Mr. Peanutbutter sighs</description>-<description>gulls squawking</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:59"><subtitle>
So, listen.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:01"><subtitle>
As you know, one of the differencesbetween agents and managers--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:03"><subtitle>
-Oh, my God. Stop. Please stop.-I'm producing a new TV show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:06"><subtitle>
It's a phenomenal script which mayor may not involve ghost or newts.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:10"><subtitle>
-Does it involve ghost or newts?-It may!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:13"><subtitle>
-You haven't read it, have you?-Read it? I'm producing it!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:17"><subtitle>
-Right.-It's this gritty, hard-boiled mystery--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:20"><subtitle>
-Ugh! I'm so sick of mysteries.-Right, well--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:23"><subtitle>
They're impossible to figure out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:24"><subtitle>
Then all of a sudden, some random detailmakes the hero remember a conversationthat totally re-contextualizes everything,and then it all magically comes together.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:31"><subtitle>
-Sure, but---It's such bullshit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:33"><subtitle>
Where's my random detail that's gonnasuddenly make everything make sense?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:36"><subtitle>
Because I would love that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:37"><subtitle>
Well, this script is really special,and everyone wants to play the lead,from Matthew McConaugheyto Matthew Perry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:43"><subtitle>
-Matthew Perry?-Yeah. But I was thinking--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:45"><subtitle>
Hold on. Matthew Perry...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:49"><subtitle>
Hey, BoJack, which oneof these pictures more says,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:53"><subtitle>
"This daughter looks like a cool ladythat I wanna have in my life"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:58"><subtitle>
Why do you ask?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:59"><subtitle>
I'm writing a letter to my momand I want to include a picture.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:02"><subtitle>
I'm going to send itto the adoption agency.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:04"><subtitle>
Maybe if they still have her addresson file, they can forward it to her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:07"><subtitle>
Seems like a long shot. How abouta better strategy is, don't do that,and then you won't be disappointedwhen it doesn't work out?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:13"><subtitle>
I'm trying everything.I don't wanna look back at thisand feel like the endof "Chandler's List," you know?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:17"><subtitle>
-You mean Schindler's List.-Never saw it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:19"><subtitle>
I'm talking about "Chandler's List,"the sketch from when Matthew Perryhosted SNL.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:23"><subtitle>
-Remind me?-Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:25"><subtitle>
So it's Chandler from Friends,and it's World War II,and he's got this list.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:28"><subtitle>
And the whole time, he's like,"I'm Chandler!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:30"><subtitle>
Could I have a bigger list?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:32"><subtitle>
But then at the end, the war's over,and he's like...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:34"><subtitle>
-"Could I have had a bigger list?"-Whoa.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:37"><subtitle>
He's haunted because he feelslike he could have done more.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:39"><subtitle>
You know, he's like,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:41"><subtitle>
"Could I be any more feelinglike I could have done more?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:46"><subtitle>
I have to go.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:06"><subtitle>
-Me neither.-I gotta get in better shape.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:08"><subtitle>
I keep saying I'm gonna run more,but it's just so hard to stay motivated.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:11"><subtitle>
Hmm.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:13"><subtitle>
Don't "hmm." I'm talking to you.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:12:22"><subtitle>
-Can you not start and stop so much?-I can't control the traffic, darling.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:25"><subtitle>
When the car in front of me starts,I start. And when it stops, I stop.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:29"><subtitle>
Maybe you don't have to startevery time the car in front of you starts,because you know it's gonnastop again anyway.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:34"><subtitle>
-You could leave a little space.-Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:37"><subtitle>
-<description>engine rumbles</description>-And another car just cut in front of mebecause I left a little space.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:42"><subtitle>
Well, I'm sorry, but I'm getting carsick.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:44"><subtitle>
Okay. I'm gonna get some gas.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:53"><subtitle>
All right. I got the lowdown.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:54"><subtitle>
First of all, very important,I got you this flattened penny.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:57"><subtitle>
I will cherish it always.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:59"><subtitle>
-I'm sorry for being annoying before.-Don't worry about it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:02"><subtitle>
Here's the deal.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:03"><subtitle>
With this traffic,we can stay on our current trajectoryand get to Hawaii just in timeto spend two luxurious hoursat the Honolulu Stilton,and then turn around and come back,or we can hang out hereat the Thrifty Lodgeat this charming halfway to Hawaiirest area and gas park.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:19"><subtitle>
Excuse me,we would like your finest room, please.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:22"><subtitle>
-All our rooms are the same.-What kind of cuisine is on premises?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:25"><subtitle>
There's a deli at the gas stationacross the street.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:28"><subtitle>
-And what are your spa hours?-There's no spa.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:30"><subtitle>
Okay, if I wanted to have a big gala,could I use your grand ballroom for that,or is that booked months in advance?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:35"><subtitle>
I could settle for a demi-ballroomin a pinch,but attire will be formal,I don't wanna upstage the venue.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:40"><subtitle>
We have zero ballroomsin this Thrifty Lodge.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:42"><subtitle>
I see. This will do nicely.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:46"><subtitle>
Didn't you tell me onceyou always wanted a ballroom?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:48"><subtitle>
Actually, no. <description>chuckles</description>What I wanted was a Belle-room.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:52"><subtitle>
What is that? Like a room full of bells?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:54"><subtitle>
It's a room full of big books,with big windows and a ladder,like Belle got in Beauty and the Beast.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:59"><subtitle>
-And it's called a Belle-room?-It's called a library.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:02"><subtitle>
But I called it a Belle-roombecause it was magical.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:05"><subtitle>
And since it was a name I made upfor a room that wasn't real,that meant that it was just mine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:09"><subtitle>
That's adora-Belle.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:11"><subtitle>
-<description>woman</description> Hey, Seaborn! Seaborn!-What's that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:13"><subtitle>
You're Seaborn's Seahorse Milk, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:15"><subtitle>
Ha! That's right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:16"><subtitle>
Oh, man! Can I get a shellfie?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:18"><subtitle>
That's like a shellfish versionof a selfie.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:20"><subtitle>
-Hmm?-Go, take a picture.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:23"><subtitle>
It'll make their day.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:24"><subtitle>
-You sure? You don't mind?-I'll be in the room.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:26"><subtitle>
Don't stay outwith your new friends too late.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:28"><subtitle>
Hey, guys. I'm coming down.What other of my things do you like?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:31"><subtitle>
<description>man</description> Wow, yeah!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:35"><subtitle>
Okay, so...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:49"><subtitle>
<description>snoring</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:56"><subtitle>
Oh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:58"><subtitle>
Hey.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:06"><subtitle>
<description>Jose</description> So the supplier said,"I really oughta give Iowa a try."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:09"><subtitle>
But I said, "Buddy, Kansas City'sabout as far as I can go."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:12"><subtitle>
Long story short,we're meeting in St. Louis.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:14"><subtitle>
-<description>pounding on door</description>-Huh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:16"><subtitle>
-Hey!-I need to talk to Hollyhock!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:18"><subtitle>
-She's not here.-You have to let me see her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:20"><subtitle>
Please, I flew all the way hereand it's Wichita,so it's not likeI got other shit to do in Wichita.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:25"><subtitle>
No one told you to come here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:27"><subtitle>
You're the onewho likes foreign movies, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:29"><subtitle>
That part in Amelie,where she listens to the guy's story?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:31"><subtitle>
This is that part.And I'm the guy with the story.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:33"><subtitle>
And I need you to be Amelie right now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:35"><subtitle>
I don't like foreign movies.I like foreign films.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:39"><subtitle>
Okay, you're impossible.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:40"><subtitle>
The rest of you, please,just listen for a second.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:42"><subtitle>
I know you hate me.But for Hollyhock, please, listen.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:46"><subtitle>
<description>clears throat</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:48"><subtitle>
Whole time she's staying with me,it doesn't make sense, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:51"><subtitle>
If I'm her father,where is her mother?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:52"><subtitle>
Well, that's an extremelyheteronormative way</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:54"><subtitle>
-of looking at things.-No, I'm saying, medically,where is the woman I had sex withthat made her be born?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:59"><subtitle>
Right? That's why Hollyhockcame to L.A. in the first place.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:02"><subtitle>
Okay...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:03"><subtitle>
But then I thought,"What if I'm not her father?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:06"><subtitle>
You're not her father.We are her fathers.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:08"><subtitle>
You're her fathers. Yeah. I know, I know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:09"><subtitle>
Eight of you, each haveyour own cute thing, I get it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:12"><subtitle>
My point is, Hollyhock and Ihave the same DNA,but that doesn't mean I'm her father.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:16"><subtitle>
You're not.Because being a father isn't just--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:19"><subtitle>
God, I feel like you arewillfully misunderstanding me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:21"><subtitle>
What I am saying is,I'm not even her father biologically.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:24"><subtitle>
-Excuse me?-My father is her father.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:27"><subtitle>
-What?-Huh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:28"><subtitle>
<description>BoJack</description> I went to every hospitaland clerk house in L.A.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:30"><subtitle>
I waited in lines, filled out forms,talked to anyone who would talk to me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:33"><subtitle>
I wouldn't rest until I knewI'd done everything I could.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:36"><subtitle>
But there was no recordof a little horse girl</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:38"><subtitle>
born on Hollyhock's birthday...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:40"><subtitle>
Okay, so?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:41"><subtitle>
...in L.A., because Hollyhockwasn't born in L.A.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:44"><subtitle>
She was born in San Francisco.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:46"><subtitle>
I got a little bug in my brainthat my father knocked up the help.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:49"><subtitle>
So I went up there, and I didthe whole thing again, and I found it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:52"><subtitle>
The birth certificatewith her mother's name,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:54"><subtitle>
clear as day, Henrietta Platchkey.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:56"><subtitle>
-That's---But where is she now, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:58"><subtitle>
Looked her up on Facebook.I know what you think:</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:00"><subtitle>
"BoJack Horsemanhas a Facebook account?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:02"><subtitle>
Obviously, I didn't,because the Internet is for nerds.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:05"><subtitle>
But I know it's a good way to find people,so I set up an account, and I found her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:08"><subtitle>
She lives in Minneapolis.She's a nurse.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:10"><subtitle>
Her phone numberwas on her Facebook page.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:12"><subtitle>
And I wanted Hollyhock to have it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:15"><subtitle>
-You did all that?-She has to know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:16"><subtitle>
You don't have to tell her I was here.I'll stay out of her life forever.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:19"><subtitle>
You can tell her I'm an asshole.Say you found this on your own.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:22"><subtitle>
I don't care, but you haveto tell her. Please.</subtitle>

Nothing motivates like fear.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:56"><subtitle>
So remember, once you're in there,don't stop running.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:59"><subtitle>
If the clown dentists catch you,they will bite you,and they have very healthy teeth.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:03"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description> Okay, but not really, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>

Nope, really. They will actually bite you,and they do actually have rabies.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:11"><subtitle>
Wow, guess I'm gonnareally have to run.</subtitle>

Well, you did it.You made a better business.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:28"><subtitle>
We did it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:29"><subtitle>
Between your no-nonsense approachand my the-regular-amount-of-nonsenseapproach,we make a pretty good team.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:36"><subtitle>
Yes. I'm going back to my job.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:38"><subtitle>
But if anything happens hereand you need me,or if you just wanna hang out again,grab a drink,you should call me sometime.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:45"><subtitle>
Oh, um, I should tell you,I'm actually asexual.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:49"><subtitle>
Yeah, I know. So am I.That's why I'm asking you out.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:14"><subtitle>
I screwed up. I'm sorry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:16"><subtitle>
I promised you'd do this show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:18"><subtitle>
I don't know why. I just...I needed something--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:21"><subtitle>
-I'll do it.-What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:22"><subtitle>
You want me to do it, I'll do it.God knows you've done enough for me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:26"><subtitle>
-<description>groans</description>-What's wrong? I said I'd do it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:29"><subtitle>
It's just really hard to need people.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:33"><subtitle>
Yeah, but...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:35"><subtitle>
Yeah. Thank you.</subtitle>

-Water.-Water? "Water" you pregnant?</subtitle>
</timestamp>

<description>chuckles</description> Very much not so.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:46"><subtitle>
-I heard you got a new boyfriend.-We broke up.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:48"><subtitle>
Oh. Sounds like an asshole.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:51"><subtitle>
He was actually the first guy I ever datedwho wasn't an asshole.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:55"><subtitle>
-Well, onwards and upwards.-I heard you had a kid living with you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:59"><subtitle>
No. She's got these adopted dads.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:02"><subtitle>
They're total dicks,but they take care of her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:04"><subtitle>
-She'll have a good life.-Oh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:06"><subtitle>
-You ever think of adopting?-<description>sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:09"><subtitle>
-More and more lately.-You should. You'd be a good mom.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:12"><subtitle>
-The world needs good moms.-I'll take that under advisement.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:17"><subtitle>
Well, I guess I'll see you on set.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:19"><subtitle>
I'm looking forward to it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:27"><subtitle>
Now, back to normal.Diane and Mr. Peanutbutter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:31"><subtitle>
-Here we are. The rest of our lives.-I wanna show you something.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:36"><subtitle>
I had the contractor put this togetherwhile we were gone. Close your eyes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:39"><subtitle>
-<description>Diane</description> Okay...-All right. Open them.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:42"><subtitle>
-Oh, my God! It's---Pretty cool, huh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:45"><subtitle>
-Why would you do this?-It's what you always wanted, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:48"><subtitle>
It's too much. I didn't want it like this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:51"><subtitle>
-Like what?-I don't know. I'm sorry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:53"><subtitle>
This is great. I'm sorry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:56"><subtitle>
Why would you think I would like this?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:57"><subtitle>
Because you told methis is what you always dreamed of?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:00"><subtitle>
I don't like big gestures like this!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:02"><subtitle>
-How many times have I--?-Yeah, but this is--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:04"><subtitle>
This was a fantasy,something that belonged to me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:08"><subtitle>
Why couldn't you have asked me--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:09"><subtitle>
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I ever tryto surprise you, or do nice things.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:12"><subtitle>
Do you know how much it costto get 5,000 fake books?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:15"><subtitle>
-So I'm the bitch? Is that what you---I'm sorry that I wanted to make our homefeel like a placethat you would want to livethat could be yours as well as mine!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:22"><subtitle>
Why is that so important to you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:24"><subtitle>
Because otherwise,it feels like you're a guest.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:26"><subtitle>
And unlike the talking candlestickin the aforementioned Disney film,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:29"><subtitle>
I don't want you to be that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:31"><subtitle>
It makes me feel shitty.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:32"><subtitle>
Like you're just visiting here,until the next thingand you're gonna leave mewhen you get boredor you find something better.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:37"><subtitle>
Like Katrina did. Like Jessica did.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:39"><subtitle>
You can't use your ex-wives against me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:42"><subtitle>
I'm just telling you how I feel.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:44"><subtitle>
I was trying to do a nice thing for you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:46"><subtitle>
