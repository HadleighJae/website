<timestamp time="00:00:53"><subtitle>
-You're doing great, BoJack.-Yeah?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:55"><subtitle>
And I did a great job watching you,which is most of what producing is.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:59"><subtitle>
We're doing it, buddy! First day!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:01"><subtitle>
Listen, I still have some questionsabout my character,and the script, and the show,and you asking me to do this show,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:06"><subtitle>
-and me saying, "Yes".-Hey, can we get rid of Philbert's watch?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:10"><subtitle>
The network doesn't want usto remind the audienceabout the existence of clocks.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:13"><subtitle>
And why we're making a TV showfor What-Time-Is-It-Right-Now-dot-com,which is a website for peoplewho don't know their computersalready have built-in clocksat the corner of the screen?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:23"><subtitle>
All your questions will be answered.</subtitle>

-BoJack Horseman...-Oh, jeez. Here we go.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:13"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:15"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:26"><subtitle>
Why does John Philbert's houselook the same as my house?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:29"><subtitle>
I've never been to your house.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:30"><subtitle>
The set was designed to reflectDetective Philbert.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:34"><subtitle>
Spare, lonely, precariously balancedon a hill of his own isolation.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:39"><subtitle>
It kind of lookslike David Boreanaz's house.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:41"><subtitle>
The set designeractually took a tour there.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:43"><subtitle>
Oh, that's very interesting.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:45"><subtitle>
Why are you here?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:46"><subtitle>
I'm playing Julius Caesaron the stage next door, in a movie!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:50"><subtitle>
Well, it's a short film.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:51"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:11"><subtitle>
Sorry, I can't do you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:13"><subtitle>
I'm too distracted, I'd just do a bad job.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:15"><subtitle>
You know your own body better than meanyway so just go to town.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:18"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:19"><subtitle>
Wait, Gina.Can I ask you a question, about you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:22"><subtitle>
Uh-huh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:23"><subtitle>
Do you think I'm right, andthe Philbert character is poorly written,and Flip needs to write him better,so I don't look so bad?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:29"><subtitle>
Look, I do one of these shows every year.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:31"><subtitle>
And I keep getting hiredbecause I show up, do the work,and keep my head down.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:34"><subtitle>
But do you love this script?Do you love your character?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:37"><subtitle>
Do I love Internal Affairs DirectorSassy Malone,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:40"><subtitle>
whose primary character traitsare that she hates bras</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:43"><subtitle>
and loves cold rooms?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:44"><subtitle>
Not especially.It feels gratuitous and male-gazey.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:47"><subtitle>
But it pays for my expensive habitof having a mortgage</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:49"><subtitle>
-in Southern California.-You don't have to go.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:52"><subtitle>
We could hang out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:53"><subtitle>
I'm sure you don't wanna be all alonein a house by yourself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:56"><subtitle>
No, I love being alone.I wish I were alone right now.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:17"><subtitle>
There's nothing to seethat would embarrass any of us.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:19"><subtitle>
-We are all fully clothed.-Ha-ha. If you say so!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:23"><subtitle>
What are you gonna dowhile I'm at work all day?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:25"><subtitle>
There's an old frogwho lives down in the L.A. River.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:28"><subtitle>
He owes me an egg salad sandwich,on account of a caper we once went on.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:32"><subtitle>
-What?-I was gonna see if he wantsto make instruments out of shoeboxesand rubber bands.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:37"><subtitle>
And, uh, that will satisfy you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:39"><subtitle>
When your life is ends,and you're looking back at this day,you'll think that was a good day?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:44"><subtitle>
Yeah?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:49"><subtitle>
Well, from your preliminary paperworkyou seem like a perfect candidate.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:52"><subtitle>
Thanks, I just never thoughtit would be like this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:55"><subtitle>
I mean, my mom popped out kidsby the dozen. And I can't even--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:58"><subtitle>
Mnh-mnh. Princess Carolyn,is your name Cutie Cutie Cupcake?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:01"><subtitle>
-No, that's---Were you born on August 12th, 1947?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:04"><subtitle>
-I---Do you sleep with your hands stuffed</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:06"><subtitle>
-in lotion-filled socks?-No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:08"><subtitle>
Right, because you are not your mother.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:11"><subtitle>
-How did you know---What you are is noble,honorable, and unimpeachable.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:15"><subtitle>
Anyone can just have a baby.But to adopt one? That takes a hero.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:20"><subtitle>
It takes a selfless, giving,kickass superwomanwho's willing to take outher checkbook right nowand write the adoption agencya check for $60,000.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:30"><subtitle>
Well. <description>sighs</description> Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:31"><subtitle>
Fabulous.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:32"><subtitle>
I'm just so gladthat I'm on this journey with you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:35"><subtitle>
Princess Carolyn,I'm with you every step of the way,from you giving me this checkall the way to me introducing youto your new caseworker, Tracy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:43"><subtitle>
-Hey.-Ah!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:44"><subtitle>
You're in wonderful hands, bye!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:46"><subtitle>
Uh, what--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:47"><subtitle>
Congratulations. What are you,like, five months pregnant?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:50"><subtitle>
No, I'm not a birth mother. I'm adopting.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:53"><subtitle>
Oh, that makes sense.'Cause you're so old.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:55"><subtitle>
Is Mikhaela ever coming back?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:57"><subtitle>
-<description>scoffs</description> Yeah, in your dreams.-<description>sighs</description></subtitle>

Yes. Yes. No. Yes. What?!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:07"><subtitle>
Jeanine, the scriptcalls for hot and haunted.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:10"><subtitle>
Does this girl look hotand haunted to you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:12"><subtitle>
Yeah, I'm sure she was hotfor Shakespeare in the Park,but I need TV hot.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:17"><subtitle>
-Actually, she's starting to look haunted.-<description>door opens</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:20"><subtitle>
-Hey! Uh, this a bad time?-It's fine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:23"><subtitle>
I can talk to you and also judgethese women's bodies at the same time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:27"><subtitle>
What do you want?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:28"><subtitle>
Okay, well, first of all,the script is great.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:30"><subtitle>
Really top-notch stuff.I love the whole... thing of it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:34"><subtitle>
I just wanted to clarify some thingsabout Philbert as a character.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:38"><subtitle>
Mm-hmm.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:39"><subtitle>
Yeah, okay, on page three,is it necessary that Philbertcan only orgasm if he's listening</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:44"><subtitle>
-to a recording of his dead wife's voice?-Yes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:47"><subtitle>
Okay, well, what about this thingon page eightwhere he goes to a strip club and justsits in the back with a sketch-padand draws the strippers,while a Leonard Cohen song plays?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:56"><subtitle>
What about it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:57"><subtitle>
It's just thatall of these half-naked women.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:59"><subtitle>
I mean, I understand it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:01"><subtitle>
I'm just worried it might come acrossas gratuitous and, uh, male-gazey,which I know it isn't!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:07"><subtitle>
Hmm. You know what? You girls can go home.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:10"><subtitle>
The stripper scene's cut.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:12"><subtitle>
-No.-Seriously?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:13"><subtitle>
-Uh, oh. Uh...-How am I gonna feed my baby?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:15"><subtitle>
I just got an idea for something better.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:18"><subtitle>
So, instead of drawing strippers naked,you're just going to draw Gina naked.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:23"><subtitle>
<description>BoJack</description> Uh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:24"><subtitle>
Gina, BoJack was concerned the old scenewas gratuitous and male-gazey.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:28"><subtitle>
Oh, he was? BoJack said that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:30"><subtitle>
<description>Flip</description> This is much more interestingand motivated by character.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:33"><subtitle>
And since it's motivated by character,that means it's not gratuitous.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:38"><subtitle>
Thank you for the note, BoJack,you really helped.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:41"><subtitle>
Yeah. Thanks, BoJack, for helping.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:43"><subtitle>
-Oh, um...-<description>Flip</description> Can we get some ice?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:45"><subtitle>
Can we get some nipple ice for Gina?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:51"><subtitle>
-So, you're the famous Yolanda.-I am not famous.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:54"><subtitle>
You might have me confusedwith another more famous Yolanda.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:56"><subtitle>
I know, I-I just meantbecause Todd talks about you so much,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:00"><subtitle>
I feel like you're famous.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:01"><subtitle>
Oh, well, that was not clear.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:03"><subtitle>
Okay. Todd, why don't you say things now?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:05"><subtitle>
Steve, you still fixing up your truck?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:07"><subtitle>
You're thinking of Emily's old boyfriend,firefighter Steve D'Marco.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:11"><subtitle>
Yeah, I'm firefighter Steve D'Mazio.We're very different.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:14"><subtitle>
But I do have a truck,and I'm fixing it up.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:16"><subtitle>
So, thanks for asking.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:17"><subtitle>
I created a dating appfor firefighters to meet me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:20"><subtitle>
-Looks like it worked.-<description>chuckles</description> Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:22"><subtitle>
Hey! We should create a dating appfor asexuals.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:26"><subtitle>
Why would asexuals want a dating app?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:28"><subtitle>
Well, not all asexuals are aromantic.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:31"><subtitle>
-Uh...-Think of it this way.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:33"><subtitle>
One could be: A, Romantic,or B, Aromantic,while also being A, Sexual, or B, Asexual.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:41"><subtitle>
So you could be BB, or BA.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:44"><subtitle>
As for me, see AB, see?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:46"><subtitle>
Uh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:47"><subtitle>
So, even within the one percentof the population that's asexual,there's an even smaller percentagethat is still lookingfor romantic companionship.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:56"><subtitle>
Seems like a pretty thin user basefor an app.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:59"><subtitle>
But without it, asexual romanticsmight end up settling for just whateverother asexual romantics they might meet,even if they have nothing else in common.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:07"><subtitle>
-Well, anyway---Yeah, but maybe it's goodif they have nothing in commonbecause then they can help each other growand change, and become fuller,more well-rounded people.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:17"><subtitle>
Yeah, that's true.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:18"><subtitle>
So, Todd, are you still doingthat rabid clown-dentist exercise thing?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:22"><subtitle>
Oh, no, that whole thing kinda fell apartwhen the clowns got loose.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

Someone keeps shouting "Wow" and "Ooh."</subtitle>

You're trying to punish me.Just don't punish Gina.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:59"><subtitle>
I'm not trying to punish anyone.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:01"><subtitle>
I'm just trying to make a good showthat's brilliant and unprecedented.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:05"><subtitle>
It sounds like you guysare basically on the same page.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:07"><subtitle>
You're the only one with a problem here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:09"><subtitle>
-Gina is fine with it.-Gina is not fine with it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:11"><subtitle>
You guys, you're almost sayingexactly the same thing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:14"><subtitle>
Except one of you is saying "not".</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:16"><subtitle>
Gina, do you have a problemwith the nudity in this scene?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:19"><subtitle>
It's great. It's brilliant, unprecedented.I'm gonna get some potatoes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:22"><subtitle>
You see? Everyone's fine with it but you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:24"><subtitle>
So, can we drop it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:26"><subtitle>
I know you're used to beingthe most important person on set.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:28"><subtitle>
-This is not about me.-It's weird for youthat I don't need to listen.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:32"><subtitle>
-I'm not---Hey, hey--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:33"><subtitle>
But if you actually have notesthat are helpful,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:35"><subtitle>
I would love to hear them whenyou're done swinging your dick around.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:38"><subtitle>
-No, this is not about my dick.-Okay, fellas...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:40"><subtitle>
-Well, maybe it should be about your dick.-What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:44"><subtitle>
Since you're so concernedabout the male gaze,let's give the femalessomething to gaze at.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:49"><subtitle>
We'll do a full-frontal nude scenewith you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:52"><subtitle>
This is compromise!This is working together.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:54"><subtitle>
-Well, hold on.-Fully exposed, Philbert reaches up</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:57"><subtitle>
-with both hands to screw in a light bulb.-Yes!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:59"><subtitle>
He totters in little circleson a tiny stool.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:03"><subtitle>
-Wouldn't I just turn my wrist?-Full body rotation. We see everything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:07"><subtitle>
Now we're talking!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:08"><subtitle>
-No, we're not! Princess---I'm on it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:10"><subtitle>
Flip, BoJack can only do this scene</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:12"><subtitle>
-if he can wear a T-shirt.-What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:13"><subtitle>
He's very self-consciousabout his belly area.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:16"><subtitle>
No, I'm self-consciousabout my penis area.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:19"><subtitle>
He can't wear a shirt.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:20"><subtitle>
It's about being vulnerable.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:22"><subtitle>
We see every fold and imperfectionof his wrinkled, saggy body.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:26"><subtitle>
-Hey!-So we like him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:28"><subtitle>
But he has to be fully erectso we respect him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:30"><subtitle>
-What?-We'll shoot it tomorrow.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:31"><subtitle>
-Yeah.-Unless you don't like this idea,in which case, we can go backto what we were doing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:35"><subtitle>
-Right.-Well--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:36"><subtitle>
So, you would be admittingthat you don't actually careabout the male gazeand you were only giving me notesto hear yourself talk.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:43"><subtitle>
But that's not it, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:45"><subtitle>
-Right.-Great.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:46"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:47"><subtitle>
-I'll send the waxing kit over tonight.-Philbert waxes?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:50"><subtitle>
Not for cosmetic purposes.He just wants to feel something.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:56"><subtitle>

I feel weird that you haveno discernible life direction.</subtitle>

-Oh.-I mean...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:21"><subtitle>
-What am I supposed to tell people?-A story? A joke?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:25"><subtitle>
Compliments are thingspeople like being told sometimes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:29"><subtitle>
I'm sorry. How was your day?Did you end up meeting with that frog?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:33"><subtitle>

</timestamp>

<timestamp time="00:14:46"><subtitle>
-She gets home pretty late.-I came all this way for nothing?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:49"><subtitle>
I brought my spinny chairand everything!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:50"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:54"><subtitle>
-You're looking for a job?-I spent all day looking!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:56"><subtitle>
First, I thoughtI should get a newspaper to find one,but then I was, like,"Where do I find a newspaper?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:01"><subtitle>
-Uh.-So, I looked it up.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:02"><subtitle>
And a map came up of my local area.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:04"><subtitle>
So, then I thought abouthow I know this area pretty well,but there's all kinds of areasI don't know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:09"><subtitle>
-Like South Africa.-Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:11"><subtitle>
-And then I thought about Charlize Theron.-Uh, right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:13"><subtitle>
And then I thought aboutthat movie Monster.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:16"><subtitle>
And then I was, like,"What year did that come out?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:18"><subtitle>
-So I went to Monster.com...-<description>pc clacking</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:42"><subtitle>
When you get in the building,say you need to use the WC.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:44"><subtitle>
Then you'll sneak into the officeof one of the network execs.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:47"><subtitle>
Go into their emailand send a message to Flip McVickertelling him he can't filmany more nude scenesbecause they're derivativeand unnecessary,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:54"><subtitle>
-especially the nude scenes involving me.-You are throwing a lotta words at me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:58"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:02"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:16:08"><subtitle>
Yep. Now, if you'll excuse me,I must adjourn to the restroom.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:17:19"><subtitle>
Have you tried just talkingto the show runner?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:21"><subtitle>
In my experience,I've found it's best to shoot straight,in the boardroom and on the driving range.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:27"><subtitle>
-<description>grunts</description>- I gotta jet.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:29"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:39"><subtitle>
-I'm not doing the naked scene.-What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:40"><subtitle>
The only reason you wrote itis to embarrass me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:43"><subtitle>
BoJack, I'm not writing scenesfor my television showand also directing themin order to teach you lessonsor send you secret messages.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:51"><subtitle>
I'm just trying to make a good show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:53"><subtitle>
-Why do you keep making it so difficult?-I'm making it difficult?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:56"><subtitle>
I have done nothing,but be a friend to you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:59"><subtitle>
I actually called my mom last nightand told her that I made a friend on set.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:03"><subtitle>
Do you wanna make me a liar to my mother?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:06"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:09"><subtitle>
-No.-Take off that robe right now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:12"><subtitle>
Why can't you act like a professionaland get naked?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:15"><subtitle>
Because it's dumb!This whole show is duuuuuuumb!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:19"><subtitle>
What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:20"><subtitle>
It's confusing, it's overwritten,and it's poorly lit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:22"><subtitle>
The darkness is a metaphor for darkness!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:26"><subtitle>
And worst of all, it's boring!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:27"><subtitle>
It has nothing to say,and it says that nothing badly!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:32"><subtitle>
<description>inhales</description> Let me tell youhow this is going to be.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:18:35"><subtitle>
I am the show creatorand if I want your character to get naked,he gets naked.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:40"><subtitle>
If I want him to speak only in Korean,you're learning Korean.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:44"><subtitle>
If I want your character to shit his pantsand walk around with shit in his pantsfor the rest of the season,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:49"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:29"><subtitle>
Is there any wayyou can be a little more thoughtfulwith the way you manage me as a client?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:34"><subtitle>
It sounds like what you're looking foris an adoption manager.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:37"><subtitle>
This is an adoption agency.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:39"><subtitle>
-Do you not know the difference?-<description>sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:41"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:19:50"><subtitle>
<description>BoJack</description> Princess Carolyyyyyyyn,I need to talk to youuuuuu.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:55"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:56"><subtitle>
-BoJack.-Hold on, I got a thing with a chair.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:59"><subtitle>
How did you even find me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:01"><subtitle>
Duh. Bought a burner phone,slipped it into your purse,and then used the Find My Phone app.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:05"><subtitle>
How thoughtful.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:06"><subtitle>
<description>deep voice</description> Hello, Princess Carolyn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:08"><subtitle>
Oh, God.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:09"><subtitle>
I have a plan and I need your help.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:11"><subtitle>
-I found out his mom has a fake leg.-Who's mom?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:13"><subtitle>
Flip. I'm gonna seduce her, steal her leg,and then smack him across the face with ituntil he chokes on his own blood.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:20"><subtitle>
It's subtle,but I think he'll get the message.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:23"><subtitle>
BoJack, what are you tryingto accomplish here?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:25"><subtitle>
I-I don't want to do the show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:27"><subtitle>
So you're gonna run awaylike you always do?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:28"><subtitle>
Yeah. I never wanted to do this show!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:30"><subtitle>
-You faked my signature!-And I told you that,and you said, "Okay" because you wantedto be a good friend to me!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:36"><subtitle>
So, you can't get points for thatand then resent me for it now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:39"><subtitle>
-It's not about you! I don't like him!-Oh, Flip's not that bad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:42"><subtitle>
He's just insecureand is overcompensating a little.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:45"><subtitle>
I know that must bea foreign concept for you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:47"><subtitle>
No, not Flip. Philbert.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:49"><subtitle>
He-he's a drunk.He's an asshole. I don't want to be him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:53"><subtitle>
So, maybe don't be the drunk asshole.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:55"><subtitle>
Maybe this time, you have a good attitudeand you don't drink so muchand you show up at your call time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:01"><subtitle>
And then you put on the Philbert costumeand you pretend to be this other guy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:06"><subtitle>
And then when you're done shooting,you take off your costumeand you're BoJack, the star of the showthat everybody likes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:13"><subtitle>
-Yeah?-Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:14"><subtitle>
