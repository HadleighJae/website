As a born and raised American,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:06"><subtitle>
you never felt much connectionto your Vietnamese heritage,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:09"><subtitle>
and your parents offered littleto fill in the blanks.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:12"><subtitle>
G'aw! You call that a fastball?</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:05:51"><subtitle>
By the time we got him off,his tongue was completely numb,which made him talk real funny.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:55"><subtitle>
-Mm-hmm.-Well, that got him in quite the situationwhen the mob boss, at the roller rink,thought he was making funof his deaf sister.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:54"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:08"><subtitle>
-Ooh!-Have you dined with us before?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:10"><subtitle>
-Yes.-Well...the way it works around here is:you look at a menu,pick what you want, I'll bring it to you,and then you pay at the end.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:17"><subtitle>
So, like, a restaurant.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:18"><subtitle>
-Ooh, sounds great.-Can I get you started with drinks?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:21"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:24"><subtitle>

-Okay.-Me, too! What are the odds?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:28"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:44"><subtitle>
-No, why would you ask---Oh, I like everything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:46"><subtitle>
In fact, at the end of my shift,I usually take everyone's leftover scrapsand put it in a trough and eat it up.Miam, miam, miam, miam!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:52"><subtitle>
-But don't mention that to my boss.-We won't.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:54"><subtitle>
But that does sound eclecticand delectable.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:56"><subtitle>
The trough of everything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:58"><subtitle>
-Okay, and---Whoa, somebody's not hungry at all.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:08:01"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:07"><subtitle>
-Why do you keep humoring her?-She's fun.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:10"><subtitle>
You know, if we were still married,this would probably be enoughto spiral us off into a big argument,that isn't even about the waitress,and we would fight all night.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:17"><subtitle>
But since we're not married,I can just be like, whatever.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:20"><subtitle>
-This is truly great.-So... great.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:23"><subtitle>
We are doing so great.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:26"><subtitle>
Although...</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:10:16"><subtitle>
It's what I can afford and it makes mefeel good to do it on my own.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:19"><subtitle>
When this place makes you too sad,you can always come over.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:21"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:38"><subtitle>
Oh, can we finally talk shitabout Mr. Peanutbutter?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:40"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:50"><subtitle>
When have you not told me how you felt?All you do is tell me how you really feel.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:58"><subtitle>

Romantically.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:58"><subtitle>
Who isn't you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:00"><subtitle>
That was probablynot the best way to say it.</subtitle>

There's a fire extinguisher under my desk.Oh, that's what's on fire? In that case...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:17"><subtitle>
<description>Diane</description> The real reasonyou go to Vietnam</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:20"><subtitle>
is because you accidentally seeyour soon-to-be ex-husband</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:23"><subtitle>
kiss someone else.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:24"><subtitle>
<description>both chuckle</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:25"><subtitle>
At first you think, "Oh, it's a fling.Whatever, they're drunk, it's a party."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:30"><subtitle>
<description>sad tune</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:31"><subtitle>
But he puts his handon the small of her back</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:33"><subtitle>
exactly the way he used to do to you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:35"><subtitle>
<description>both</description> Mmm.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:37"><subtitle>
-It means "I've got you,"-<description>sad tunes continue</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:40"><subtitle>
and when he did it to you,it made you feel safe.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:43"><subtitle>
And you realizehe will never do that to you again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:48"><subtitle>
-<description>crying</description>-And it breaks your heart, again...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:51"><subtitle>
after your heart was so brokenthat you thought</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:53"><subtitle>
it could never get any more broken.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:56"><subtitle>
You thought it was safe,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:58"><subtitle>
but it still, somehow,finds a new way to break.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:25:02"><subtitle>
Because, even though,you're the one who asked for this,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:25:05"><subtitle>
now that you've got it,you are completely adrift</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:25:09"><subtitle>
with no compass, or map,or sense of where to go, or what to do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:25:14"><subtitle>
So you go to Vietnam.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:25:17"><subtitle>
You think you might find community,a connection to something bigger,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:25:21"><subtitle>
but... you don't.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:25:23"><subtitle>
In fact, you feel even more alonethan you were before you left.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:25:28"><subtitle>
But... you survive.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:25:30"><subtitle>
<description>sad tunes continue</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:25:33"><subtitle>
You learn that you can survivebeing alone.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:25:39"><subtitle>
