I think, the most important thing hereis that we're honest with each otherand ourselves. Do you agree?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:14"><subtitle>
Uh, yes?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:15"><subtitle>
It says, here, you failedyour last six health inspections.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:18"><subtitle>
-Ooh.-How are you still in business?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:19"><subtitle>
I wanna say moxie?But possibly spunk.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:23"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description> I can't believeI fell asleep at your house.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:26"><subtitle>
-These shoots are messing up my rhythm.-It's so weird waking up at 6:00 p.m.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:29"><subtitle>
Don't worry. I'm not gonna make a habitof spending the night or day.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:32"><subtitle>
I get it. We work together,we make sex together,we don't talk about feelings,and yet sometimesa begrudging respect can blossom into--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:39"><subtitle>
-Nope.-"Blossoms into nothing"is what I was gonna say.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:41"><subtitle>
You cut me off, so you look stupid.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:44"><subtitle>
Well, you look stupid when you sleep.Look, I took some dumb pictures.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:47"><subtitle>
-<description>BoJack</description> All right.-Stupid. Real stupid.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:49"><subtitle>
-<description>BoJack</description> You can delete some.-You have a weird eye.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:51"><subtitle>
-Obsessed much?-This is what it would look likeif corpses could drool. <description>laughs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:55"><subtitle>
-Hi, excuse me, can I get The BoJack?-What is that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:57"><subtitle>
It's an off-the-menu itemfor those in the know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:00"><subtitle>
Obviously, I'm BoJackand I always order the BoJack sandwich.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:03"><subtitle>
That's kooky.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:04"><subtitle>
Why would your name be a sandwich name?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:07"><subtitle>
Because I own this restaurantand I'm a celebrity.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:09"><subtitle>
So, are all sandwiches namedafter celebrities?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:13"><subtitle>
Is chicken salad a celebrity?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:14"><subtitle>
No, that's just a thingthey put in the sandwich.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:17"><subtitle>
That's not someone's name.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:18"><subtitle>
Can't it be both? My name is Pickles.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:20"><subtitle>
-What?-I'll have a burger.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:21"><subtitle>
BoJack, I'm going to the can.Have fun with the waitress.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:24"><subtitle>
-<description>water running</description>-<description>humming rhythmically</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:29"><subtitle>
-Um.-It's me, Pickles, from before.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:31"><subtitle>
-It's cool dating a celebrity.-Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:33"><subtitle>
I'm also dating a celebrity.Should we start a club?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:35"><subtitle>
-I call vice president.-I'm not dating anyone.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:38"><subtitle>
And if I had to guess,I'd say neither are you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:40"><subtitle>
Guys in this town, especially celebrities,are not exactly the settle-down type.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:44"><subtitle>
That's why I hit the jackpot with my guy.He doesn't have a problem committing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:47"><subtitle>
In fact,he just got out of his third marriage.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:50"><subtitle>
A celebrity who just got divorced.Yeah. No way he'll break your heart.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:54"><subtitle>
Do you think Mr. Peanutbutter and Iare moving too fast?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:57"><subtitle>
I don't know you or your relationship,but I have been around the blocka few times.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:01"><subtitle>
I was even on an ABC procedural,called The Block, which aired a few times.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:04"><subtitle>
The key is to have zero expectations,and then you'll never be disappointed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:09"><subtitle>
Hmm.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:10"><subtitle>
Yeah, zero expectations,which also seems to be the mantraof this restaurant.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:15"><subtitle>
Thank you.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:03:13"><subtitle>
She looks dead.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:14"><subtitle>
But I'm not a doctor, I'm a sassy cop.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:16"><subtitle>
Poor girl had dreams.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:17"><subtitle>
And there's nothing more preciousthan dreams.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:20"><subtitle>
Philbert takes a drag of his cigarette,then kneels down to inspect the corpse.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:24"><subtitle>
-<description>Flip</description> Cut!-<description>buzzer buzzes</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:25"><subtitle>
BoJack,you said the stage directions again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:28"><subtitle>
Sorry. My brain is kinda muddled.It's these night shoots.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:31"><subtitle>
I think it works.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:32"><subtitle>
John Philbert doesn't play by the rules.He says his stage directions out loud.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:36"><subtitle>
It's confusing, which meansthe show is daring and smart.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:39"><subtitle>
-Hey, wanna go check out craft services?-Mm-mm.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:41"><subtitle>
How could whatever you're listening tobe more fun</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:43"><subtitle>
than hearing me rantabout the fruit spread?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:45"><subtitle>
Is your rant honeydew related?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:47"><subtitle>
It's in the honeydew area,but the specifics arewhat keep it fresh each time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:51"><subtitle>
Uh-huh.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:58"><subtitle>
Sorry, I didn't realize how late it got.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:00"><subtitle>
If only there was an easy way</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:02"><subtitle>
to keep trackof what time it is right now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:04"><subtitle>
-I'll go change.-No, keep your suit on.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:06"><subtitle>
My parents are gonna be impressedI'm dating an executive.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:08"><subtitle>
Cool!I've never impressed parents before.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:11"><subtitle>
I believe that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:12"><subtitle>
Listen, I haven't told my familyI'm asexual,so it might be best if, for tonight,we just pretend we're sexually active.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:20"><subtitle>
I mean, it's a family dinner.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:21"><subtitle>
What are the odds they're going to askquestions about our sexuality, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:25"><subtitle>
Right...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:26"><subtitle>
<description>mystery music</description></subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:04:48"><subtitle>

Oh, my God. Are you the umlautin ChloÃ« Sevigny's name, right now?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:54"><subtitle>
Because I don't know why you're here,but I'm glad you are.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:57"><subtitle>
As Courteney Cox said when she discovereda rotting corpse in the woods</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:00"><subtitle>
near the Cougar Town set,"Good God, I hope you're not busy."</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:05"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:07"><subtitle>
I just heard that they're going to blow upthe International Space Station.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:11"><subtitle>
-Oh, my God. Blow it up? Why?-No one knows why space people do things.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:15"><subtitle>
But I thought we could road tripout to the desertand witness the explosionin all her glory.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:20"><subtitle>
That sounds amazing!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:21"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:27"><subtitle>
Yeah! But... are we moving too fast?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:31"><subtitle>
A wise lady, in the bathroom,told me some stuff.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:34"><subtitle>
-Ooh, she sounds smart. Better listen.-I think her name was Hamburger.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:37"><subtitle>
Maybe we should wait, some days,before going on another date.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:39"><subtitle>
Okay. If that's how you feel,you stay here and do nothing,and I'll go have this amazing,once-in-a-lifetime experienceall by myself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:46"><subtitle>
It does sound cool.I could also drive to the desert.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:50"><subtitle>
If we're both going,we might as well carpool.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:52"><subtitle>
That's smart! But just to be clear,we're slowing things down.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:55"><subtitle>
It's not a date.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:57"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description> Exactly.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:58"><subtitle>
Is this that mysterious,brown hors d'oeuvre</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:00"><subtitle>

I mean,it's technically a musical about corn,but it's actually sophisticated.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:24"><subtitle>
Wait a second.Are you... into musicals?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:27"><subtitle>
I sense you'll make this a thing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:29"><subtitle>
Well, well, well, the stone-hearted cynic,who thinks feelings are for suckers,has a secret soft spot for sappy musicals.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:35"><subtitle>
-Okay.-When you say, "Okay,"do you mean okay like "correct,"or okay like "OK-lahoma"?</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:09:49"><subtitle>
When I was a little girl, my mom took meto see A Kernel of Truth on Broadway.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:53"><subtitle>
It wasn't a big hit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:54"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:57"><subtitle>
That Frank Rich could bea real frank bitch, am I right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:59"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:01"><subtitle>
I spent my childhood dreaming of, one day,getting to sing on Broadway.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:04"><subtitle>
But, I guess, I wasn't good enough.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:06"><subtitle>
So now I get steady TV work,which is fine, and I'm fine,but I still listen to that musicalbecause it reminds me of a timewhen I was less jaded,when I believed I could do anything,and that makes me feel good.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:19"><subtitle>
Oh, my God, Gina.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:20"><subtitle>
I-I didn't realize how muchthis musical meant to you.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:27"><subtitle>
<description>laughs</description> Oh, come on!</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:31"><subtitle>
-Hmm.-I quickly realized I wasn't into it,but Mindy found out,and now that I have a boyfriend,she probably wants to have sex with youto get revenge. Typical sister stuff.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:12:28"><subtitle>
Mindy wants to meet mefor backyard sex at midnight,and your mother knows I'm asexual.</subtitle>

She showed me her boobs.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:12:34"><subtitle>

Oh, no! She'll disown me!We gotta convince her you're super horny.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:41"><subtitle>
-How?-If Mindy told my momthat you made a pass at her,that would prove you're not asexual.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:46"><subtitle>
Here's the plan.We'll wait until the cock crows midnight.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

<timestamp time="00:12:53"><subtitle>
I'll pretend I'm Mindyand tell my mother you made a pass at me.</subtitle>
