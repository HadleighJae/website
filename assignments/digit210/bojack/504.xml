</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:35"><subtitle>
First of all, I don't hate Jews.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:37"><subtitle>
If I did, would I be able to sitin the same roomas my good friend Mark Feuerstein, a Jew?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:42"><subtitle>
You know, when I first heardVance's comments, they stung,but when he called to offer his apologyand a supporting role in his next movie,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:49"><subtitle>
I thought, "Does not the Torahteach us to forgive?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:52"><subtitle>
As it is written, "schmear, don't smear."</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:17"><subtitle>
I was an immature child... of 38.I'm not that guy anymore.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

<timestamp time="00:03:40"><subtitle>
You just have to remind themhow good you are.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:42"><subtitle>
Maybe by taking a meaty role on my gritty,prestige television show Philbert.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:46"><subtitle>
Once word gets outthat it's okay to hire you again,</subtitle>
</timestamp>

Okay, I'm in.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:04:05"><subtitle>
Diane, can you believe this?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:07"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:10"><subtitle>
Ugh! This town is full of hypocrites.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:12"><subtitle>
They act all shocked when one of theirfavorite stars turns out to be a dirtbag,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:16"><subtitle>
but they can't wait to give a comebackto all the dirtbags we already know about.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:19"><subtitle>
Now, that is the kind of storyI would share without reading,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:23"><subtitle>
which, for our purposes,is even better than people reading.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:25"><subtitle>
Go to the awards show,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:27"><subtitle>
take down that skeevy so-and-so,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:29"><subtitle>
and then during commercial breaks,get in some Hollywoo hobnobbing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:33"><subtitle>
-Oh, I'd rather not.-Diane, you have to hobnob.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:36"><subtitle>
Have you not been hobnobbing?Hob that nob, girl!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:38"><subtitle>
We know how this ends.Our core readership eats it up,a bunch of dude-broscall me a "dumb slunt,"and Vance's career chugs, right along.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:46"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:12"><subtitle>
-They cut around stuff they don't need.-Oh, okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:15"><subtitle>
No one understands how to make a womanfeel beautiful like Louis Kitton.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:20"><subtitle>
Listen, kid. Dog Day Afternoonisn't gonna happen for you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:23"><subtitle>
-People don't see you as the tough guy.-That's not fair.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:26"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:28"><subtitle>
So many amazing starsare being forgiven tonight.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:31"><subtitle>
Megyn Kelly, Mark Wahlberg...<description>laughs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:33"><subtitle>
Look, every actor has a range,and maybe a gritty dramaabout a tough-guy bank robberis too much of a stretch for you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:39"><subtitle>
So, I'm not tough enough, huh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:41"><subtitle>
I'll show them how tough I can be.</subtitle>

I just don't get why you're doing this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:03"><subtitle>
-We need a big star, Diane.-No, Diane's right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:05"><subtitle>
-I'm the big star.-That's not my point.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:07"><subtitle>
You can't have two stars.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:09"><subtitle>
All the greatest detective showsare focused around a central,usually titular character.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:14"><subtitle>
Kojak, Monk, Nickis.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:16"><subtitle>
-Who's Nickis?-You know, Nickis.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:18"><subtitle>
Sometimes, he goes to Los Angeles,to New Orleans...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:20"><subtitle>
Are you...? Do you mean NCIS?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:24"><subtitle>
No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:26"><subtitle>
Princess Carolyn, if you hire this guy,what kind of message does that send?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:29"><subtitle>
Diane, we both knowthe industry is screwed up.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:31"><subtitle>
I'm not talking to the industry.I'm talking to you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:34"><subtitle>
-Take some responsibility.-Excuse me?</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:43"><subtitle>
Horseman forcefully forgoes applausefor Vance at Forgivies!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:47"><subtitle>
Is a feud forming on the Philbert front?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:49"><subtitle>
That's the buzz around town,and the question on everybody's mind is,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:53"><subtitle>
"Why the strong face?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:55"><subtitle>
He made the face in protest becauseof what Vance said about native Alaskans.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:59"><subtitle>
BoJack's clearly upsetabout the time Vance Waggonersaid the Madrid train bombingswere "a real mixed bag."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:07"><subtitle>
Remember when Vance lockedthat shopgirl in a hotel room</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:10"><subtitle>
and said, "I've got pizzazz"while masturbating into a champagne flute?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:14"><subtitle>
Because BoJack remembers.<description>slurps</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:17"><subtitle>
God damn it! The whole point of the awardwas to put the past behind me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:21"><subtitle>
But now,because of this idiot's dumb face,my past is all anyone's talking about!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:26"><subtitle>
Everyone else was clapping.Why couldn't you clap?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:28"><subtitle>
Hey, man, awards showshould've had better cheese.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:31"><subtitle>
-My publicist is furious, by the way.-Ooh, spooky publicist!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:34"><subtitle>
Hope she doesn't papercut mewith her mad press release.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:37"><subtitle>
We're gonna handle this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:38"><subtitle>
BoJack will go on TV and explainthis unfortunate faux pas du fromage.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:43"><subtitle>
-Won't you, BoJack?-Ugh. Fine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:45"><subtitle>
Once again, hero BoJack will clean upeveryone else's mess.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:54"><subtitle>
-Hello, Todd.-Ooh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:56"><subtitle>
Did you notice how I just walked inwithout knocking? Pretty tough, huh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:59"><subtitle>
Not at all!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:00"><subtitle>
To me, it read as amiable and familiar,like our friendship has an assumed"open door" policy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:05"><subtitle>
God damn it! <description>thumps</description> Owie!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:08"><subtitle>
Apparently, Hollywoo producersdon't think I'm tough enoughto play the bad boy parts.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:12"><subtitle>
-Oh, no!-Todd, you're the toughest guy I know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:15"><subtitle>
<description>giggles</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:16"><subtitle>
-Will you teach me how to be tough?-I thought you'd never ask.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:20"><subtitle>
Because I had no ideathis was happening to you.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:27"><subtitle>
BoJack, clear the air.Why'd you give Vance the face?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:31"><subtitle>
Well, there was this cheese--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:32"><subtitle>
And you're lactose intolerant,which reminded youthat Vance lacks tolerance?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:36"><subtitle>
No, it--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:37"><subtitle>
The cheese stands alone,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:39"><subtitle>
but no woman should stand alone,when standing up to sexual harassment?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:42"><subtitle>
-Squawk!-No, it wasn't any of those things!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:43"><subtitle>
So, you're saying it wasn't any one thing,more of an accumulation?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:47"><subtitle>
-It---BoJack, it is really incredible,your taking a stand against your co-star.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:51"><subtitle>
-No, I'm not taking any stand---I mean, the guy choked his wife,and most of Hollywoo is, like,"No biggie. Good for him!"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:57"><subtitle>
-Squawk!-Okay, well, obviously it's not goodhe choked his wife.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:02"><subtitle>
-Wow!-<description>cheering, applause</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:03"><subtitle>
No, no, no! I wasn't trying to makesome bold statement or anything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:06"><subtitle>
It's just that...choking your wife is bad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:09"><subtitle>

Okay.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:37"><subtitle>
BoJack is right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:38"><subtitle>
Hollywoo shouldn't legitimize abusers,by allowing them to starin movies and TV shows,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:43"><subtitle>
that play off their problematic personas!</subtitle>

I don't know, Princess Carolyn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:15"><subtitle>
Is it possible, this whole time,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:16"><subtitle>
I've been an amazing feminist hero,and nobody knew it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:19"><subtitle>
-BoJack!-Feels pretty right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:21"><subtitle>
Yeah, I'm a male feminist.You're welcome, society.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:24"><subtitle>
-I gotta call Vance.-Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:26"><subtitle>
I'm just gonna stay here, being woke.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:29"><subtitle>
Vance! Listen,BoJack's been very dehydrated.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:32"><subtitle>
No, no, no. You can't use the old"dehydration made him stupid" trick on me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:43"><subtitle>
-What?-You were right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:44"><subtitle>
All it took was one offer.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:45"><subtitle>
Once word got out I was doing Philbert,all the other offers started pouring in.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:49"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:11:07"><subtitle>
-Really makes you think, huh?-BoJack, I was wrong, you were right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:11"><subtitle>
Let's take that asshole down.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:14"><subtitle>
So, now, you wanna take him down</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:16"><subtitle>
Now, that he's not doingyour TV show, anymore?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:18"><subtitle>
Diane, don't be cynical.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:19"><subtitle>
-I'm cynical?-What do you want me to say?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:21"><subtitle>
I got blinded by my desireto see myself succeed,which, since I'm a woman,is actually very feminist.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:27"><subtitle>
But now that Vance can't help me succeed,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:29"><subtitle>
I realize the more feminist thing to dois to make sure he doesn't succeed either.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:34"><subtitle>
-I'm cynical?-I'm offering an olive branch, here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:37"><subtitle>
Look, this town loves assholes like Vance.There's nothing we can do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:40"><subtitle>
This town is as wishy-washyas a virgin on prom night.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:43"><subtitle>
All they need to listen to womenis the right voice-- a man's voice.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:48"><subtitle>
<description>BoJack</description> Oh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:49"><subtitle>
-Is that why I'm here?-Yep. I brought you two togetherbecause between your feminist brainand your stupid manly face,you can actually say thingsthat people will listen to.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:58"><subtitle>
That's a good point.People do listen to me all the time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:00"><subtitle>
One time I tweeted "RIP David Bowie,"and now everyone still thinks he's dead.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:04"><subtitle>
-David Bowie is dead.-Wait, for real? Oh, man.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:06"><subtitle>
So, through BoJack, I can saywhatever I want, to a huge audience,without being called "shrill,"or "naggy," or "classic Diane."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:15"><subtitle>
Yeah. Everyone loves a male feminist.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:17"><subtitle>
It turns out, the problemwith feminism, all along,is it just wasn't men doing it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:22"><subtitle>
We're much less shrill.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:23"><subtitle>
Yeah, this is truly a great dayfor women everywhere.</subtitle>

Okay, how do I make people thinkI'm a tough bad boy,who doesn't give a careabout society's precious rules?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:34"><subtitle>
Every time Vance Waggonerbreaks the rules,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:37"><subtitle>
-it gets caught on camera.-That's it!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:40"><subtitle>
We just need some video evidenceof me being tough!</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:12:59"><subtitle>
-Thank you. So much.-Huh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:02"><subtitle>
Two weeks ago, we buried my father.Lung cancer.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:05"><subtitle>
My baby girl made me promiseI'd quit smoking,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:08"><subtitle>
but I've been sneakingthese suicide sticks this entire time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:12"><subtitle>
No more. That was my last cigarette.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:13:18"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:19"><subtitle>
You are truly a kindand approachable character.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:23"><subtitle>
And tough?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:26"><subtitle>

-Okay, just...-<description>marker squeaking</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:35"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description> Okay, so, pop cultureinherently normalizes things,and that power works both ways.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:41"><subtitle>
It can normalize things for good,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:42"><subtitle>
like how dancing Ellen makesmiddle America less afraid of gay people.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:45"><subtitle>
But it can also normalize thingsfor bad,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:47"><subtitle>
like what Jack Bauer did for torture,or what Jimmy Fallon did for lip-syncing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:52"><subtitle>
So, when we give a platformto known abusers like Vance Waggoner,that's an example of...?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:59"><subtitle>
Normalizing things for...?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:04"><subtitle>
-Good or bad?-I'm sorry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:06"><subtitle>
I know you're trying really hardnot to be boring,and it's kind of not boring,but it still mostly feelslike I'm being lectured at.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:13"><subtitle>
-Okay, well---Hold on.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:14"><subtitle>
Let me imagine that I'm saying it.You know what, that's a little better.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:18"><subtitle>
Well, the bar for men is depressingly low.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:20"><subtitle>
Just sprinkle in a few words like"intersectionality" or "micro-aggressions"and Vice News will name youFeminist of the Year.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:26"><subtitle>
Oh, should I wear a T-shirtthat says "Feminism is Bae"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:29"><subtitle>
Girls love shit like that, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>

-Hello, Diane.-<description>yelps</description> How did you get in my car?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:41"><subtitle>
-You left it unlocked.-It's a Prius. It locks automatically.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:44"><subtitle>
Priuses unlock automatically.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:46"><subtitle>
You still need to lock itwhen you get out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:48"><subtitle>
-Really?-I know you and your little Scooby gangare plotting something against my client,and I want you to stop.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:54"><subtitle>
Ugh! Of course that dirtbagwould hire Ana Spanakopita.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:58"><subtitle>
Vance has a troubled past.All he's asking for is a fresh start.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:02"><subtitle>
-No. Why does he get that over and over?-He's reformed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:06"><subtitle>
What else would you have him do?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:07"><subtitle>
Let's say, you can make him doanything you want to make things right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:10"><subtitle>
What would you makeVance Waggoner do, now?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:15"><subtitle>
Nothing.I don't think he can make things right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:18"><subtitle>
Well, then, what do you hopeto accomplish, here?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:20"><subtitle>
Can't you just admit to me,just between the two of us,that this sucks?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:24"><subtitle>
You can say it's your job, that youbelieve in "forgiveness," whatever,but don't you at least a little bit thinkthat when we let guyslike Vance off the hook...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:32"><subtitle>
-Diane.-...when you, as a woman,give awful menthe cover of your friendship,when you work for them.First of all,they're not gonna get better.Second of all, you are then complicit...no, you're culpablefor the terrible things they do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:46"><subtitle>
Are you done?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:47"><subtitle>
Just, woman to woman,can't you admit this is screwed up?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:53"><subtitle>
You've given me a lot to think about.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:57"><subtitle>
-<description>walking away</description>-<description>remote chirps, lock clicks</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:00"><subtitle>
Oh...!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:02"><subtitle>
So, in conclusion,is Smurfette a feminist icon?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:05"><subtitle>
I think the better question is,why does she have to be?,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:08"><subtitle>
We've gotten a little off track, here.We were talking about Vance Waggoner.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:12"><subtitle>
Oh, yeah!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:13"><subtitle>
We actually have a tape of a pressconference Vance gave, earlier today.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:16"><subtitle>
-What?-And he mentioned you in it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:17"><subtitle>
Oh, no, is this a Gotcha?Am I the gotcha?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:19"><subtitle>
Let's see what he had to say.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:21"><subtitle>
I have an important announcement.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:23"><subtitle>
-I... am a feminist, too.-<description>applause</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:26"><subtitle>
That's why I had to walk awayfrom BoJack Horseman's new show Philbert.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:31"><subtitle>
Okay, I read the scripts they sent me,and I was outraged.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:34"><subtitle>
Gratuitous sexual violence.Protracted, lascivious nude scenes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:38"><subtitle>
Maybe BoJack Horseman thinksthat's all in good fun,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:42"><subtitle>
but I know it's toxic.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:43"><subtitle>
And if I took part in it,I would be complicit--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:45"><subtitle>
no, culpable for that toxicity.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:48"><subtitle>
BoJack, what do you say to those charges?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:51"><subtitle>
Um...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:52"><subtitle>
The future is female?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:58"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:00"><subtitle>
Pretty cool, huh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:02"><subtitle>
-Uh, are you sure about this outfit?-All the toughest guys wear leather.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:06"><subtitle>
Biker gangs, motorcycle cops,non-heteronormative dominatrices.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:09"><subtitle>
Well, this is the sleaziest,most dangerous dive bar in Hollywoo.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:14"><subtitle>
It's where all the bad boys party.Charlie Sheen, Chris Brown, Subway Jared.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:19"><subtitle>
Great. I'll waltz right in, fighta few bouncers, throw a drink in a face,and get this menacing mugon the cover of a few tabloids.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:27"><subtitle>
-Hey.-<description>Peanutbutter</description> Hey! Bird brains!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:30"><subtitle>
Why don't you snapsome pics of me being mean?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:33"><subtitle>
Get the word outthat I'm a real tough SOAB!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:37"><subtitle>
-You? Tough? Yeah, right!-Hah!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:39"><subtitle>
I've seen tougher guys at the fancy-boybubble bath parties I sometimes attend.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:45"><subtitle>
-What?-Sorry, I can't invite ya.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:47"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:49"><subtitle>
-Well, you two have a pleasant afternoon.-No, Mr. Peanutbutter.</subtitle>

Exactly. No more clicking.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:06"><subtitle>
You fixed my TMJ, which meansno more wearing a night guard to bed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:10"><subtitle>
Wow, I already feel like a more confidentand assertive lover.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:14"><subtitle>
Thanks, Mr. Peanutbutter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:15"><subtitle>
I'm gonna go homeand make love to my wiiiiiiiiiiiiife!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:20"><subtitle>
Uh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:22"><subtitle>
My crossed eye. It-- it's fixed!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:24"><subtitle>
My depth perceptionis so much better now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:27"><subtitle>
I'm gonna go watch a Wes Anderson movieand see if I can perceiveany depth in iiiiiiiiiiit!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:34"><subtitle>
And stay out!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:39"><subtitle>
Whoa.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:40"><subtitle>
-So... did Philbert kill his wife?-Well, Sassy thinks so.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:44"><subtitle>
That's why she's pretendingto be his new partner,to get closer to the truth.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:47"><subtitle>
Meanwhile, his old partner Fritzis back in the mix,but he might be deadand just a projection</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:51"><subtitle>
-of Philbert's lingering guilt.-Ooooh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:54"><subtitle>
-That's very unclear.-Yeah, the whole thing's nonsense,but, more importantly,how do we prove it's not sexist?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:00"><subtitle>
-It is sexist.-No, of course.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:01"><subtitle>
But right now, I have to do an interviewwhere I explain that it's not,because otherwise,I'll look like a hypocrite,which would be really badfor women everywhere.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:09"><subtitle>
So, in order to save feminism,you need to give mesome smart-sounding reasonswhy Philbertisn't what it so obviously is,so that I can continue to be a heroand role model.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:20"><subtitle>
Everything Vance saidabout these scripts is true.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:22"><subtitle>
It's posing as a deconstructionof the edifice of toxic masculinity...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:26"><subtitle>
Uh-huh. Toxic masculinity, yeah. Right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:28"><subtitle>
But it's just using that, as an excuseto relish in its own excesses.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:32"><subtitle>
And the most depressing thing...is that ten times more peopleare gonna watch this showthan read anything I've ever written.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:38"><subtitle>
I feel you're not really gettinginto the spirit here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:40"><subtitle>
We can still take down Vanceand topple the patriarchy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:43"><subtitle>
Come on, we're doing feminism,it's supposed to be fun!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:46"><subtitle>
This isn't fun for me!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:47"><subtitle>
Being a woman is not a hobbyor a pet interest of mine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:51"><subtitle>
You get to drop in, and play Joss Whedon,and everybody cheers.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:54"><subtitle>
But when you move onto your next thing, I'm still here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:57"><subtitle>
Okay, yeah, I totally get that.But in the meantime,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:00"><subtitle>
I just need to know what to sayabout this show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:02"><subtitle>
Say whatever you want.I have a listicle to write.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:04"><subtitle>
So, unless you can give me"five times Rihanna gave us life,"this conversation is over.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:11"><subtitle>
BoJack Horsemanis our Deep Dive guest, today.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:14"><subtitle>
So, what's going on?Something about your show being sexist?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:18"><subtitle>
My producer printed out an articlefor me, but I did not read it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:21"><subtitle>
Look, obviously,when you take plot points out of context,they can seem unsavory.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:24"><subtitle>
But they're all part of a larger attemptto deconstruct... toxic... masculinity.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:30"><subtitle>
Ooh! Sounds glamorous!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:32"><subtitle>
No, we're not glamorizing it,that's the thing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:34"><subtitle>
You're not supposed to like John Philbertor agree with the things he does.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:37"><subtitle>
It's a TV show.It doesn't glamorize anything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:40"><subtitle>
But... maybe it normalizes it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:43"><subtitle>
I gotta go.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:45"><subtitle>
Okay. We still have 48 minutes,so, I guess I should just talk?</subtitle>

It's all the things you said it is,but it doesn't have to be.</subtitle>

Come on as a consulting producer.Work with Flip on the scripts,make the show somethingthat we can all be proud of.</subtitle>

Why would I do that?</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:55"><subtitle>
Sit in my office, don't chew too loud,and collect your paycheck.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:03"><subtitle>
"Huh, a lady worked on the show.Guess it's not sexist."</subtitle>

He just got fired off his new movieafter a drunken rant about the Chinese,and then plowed his Hummer into the sideof the Grauman's Egyptian Theatre.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:40"><subtitle>
