<description>sighs</description> Hello?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:11"><subtitle>
How the hell do they expect me to learnfive pages of dialogue in one day?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:14"><subtitle>
-What am I, Young Sheldon?-BoJack--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:16"><subtitle>
No show should have that much talking.TV is a visual medium.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:19"><subtitle>
-Anyway, where the hell are you?-Eden, North Carolina.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:22"><subtitle>
Ugh, North Carolina?That's the second worst of the Carolinas.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:25"><subtitle>
-You know I'm from here, right?-Yeah, and you got out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:28"><subtitle>
You know what "from" means?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:30"><subtitle>
You don't have to be there anymore.That's why they call it "from."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:32"><subtitle>
Okay, I'm about to befrom this conversation.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:35"><subtitle>
Wait, wait. I'm sorry.Can we just talk about Mr. Peanutbutter?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:38"><subtitle>
Why did you cast him on this show?Everybody loves him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:40"><subtitle>
I'm the guy everybody's supposed to love.I'm Philbert.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:43"><subtitle>
-Ugh!-So then I got a food truck for the crewwith a big sign that said,"From your favorite star,"but everybody thoughtit was from Mr. Peanutbutter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:50"><subtitle>
They didn't even read the sign.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:51"><subtitle>
BoJack, I'm gonna be back tomorrow.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

<description>series theme music playing</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:59"><subtitle>
Thanks for coming, all this way.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:01"><subtitle>
-We could've just talked on the phone.-I wanted to meet you in person.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:04"><subtitle>
That's the Princess Carolyn difference.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:06"><subtitle>
Ooh! I've never met a person who hada difference named after them before.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:09"><subtitle>
Well, this is important.We're here to talk about your baby.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:12"><subtitle>
I know what you're thinking;another dumb teenager,so liquored up, she forgot to make sureher boyfriend wrapped his tweedle.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:18"><subtitle>
Well, that's all true,but I'm not some backwoods hick.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:20"><subtitle>
-Oh!-I'm 18, I got my whole life ahead of me,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:23"><subtitle>
and it's not like my boyfriend's beggingme to marry him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:25"><subtitle>
Boyfriends rarely do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:27"><subtitle>
-His name's Strib, short for Dennis.-Uh, sure.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:30"><subtitle>
He's not exactly the romantic type,but he's got those eyesyou just can't say no to, you know?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:35"><subtitle>
I hope you and Strib havemany happy child-free years, together.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:38"><subtitle>
I'm willing to do whatever I canto help contribute to the child-free part.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:42"><subtitle>
-Hmm.-<description>phone buzzing, meowing</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:44"><subtitle>
Oh, sorry. It's work.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:45"><subtitle>
Everyone I work with is such a baby.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:47"><subtitle>
And I love babies!<description>laughs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:49"><subtitle>
Hello, baby.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:50"><subtitle>
Hey, listen, I know Flipjust wants me to be "the woman",</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:53"><subtitle>
and keep my mouth shut,but this show makes no sense.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:56"><subtitle>
In the rooftop motorcycle scene,Fritz and Philbert keep saying,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:59"><subtitle>
"This is so dangerous.""Yeah, man. We're really dangerous."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:02"><subtitle>
But then they just get offthe motorcycles.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:04"><subtitle>
Why aren't they skiddingtowards the side of the building,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:07"><subtitle>
and then they roll off just as their bikesgo careening over the edge?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:10"><subtitle>
Okay, sure, pitch it to Flip.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:11"><subtitle>
Everything I pitch, he shoots down.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:13"><subtitle>
That's just because it's comingfrom someone who isn't him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:16"><subtitle>
If you want him to like your idea,just convince himhe thought of it, himself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:19"><subtitle>
You really think he'll do itbecause I say it's his idea?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:22"><subtitle>
That's a great idea, Diane.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:24"><subtitle>
Oh, thanks! I'm gonna do it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:25"><subtitle>
-So sorry.-No problem.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:28"><subtitle>
Um, just so you know, I have met withsome other candidates, mostly couples.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:32"><subtitle>
Oh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:33"><subtitle>
I couldn't believe I found someonewho grew up in Eden.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:36"><subtitle>
-When's the last time you were here?-Oh, not since my mother died.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:39"><subtitle>
-Oh, I'm sorry.-It was a long time ago.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:41"><subtitle>
-She's still dead, though.-That is true.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:45"><subtitle>
<description>sipping</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:48"><subtitle>
-Sorry we had to meet at Phuzzy's.-I love Phuzzy's.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:50"><subtitle>
I bet you got fancy restaurantsin LA, huh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:53"><subtitle>
Probably a California Pizza Kitchenon every corner.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:55"><subtitle>
Or do y'all call it "Pizza Kitchen,"since you're in California?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:58"><subtitle>
No, we call it "California Pizza Kitchen,"or "CPK."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:01"><subtitle>
CPK? What kind of city person's too busyto say "California Pizza Kitchen"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:04"><subtitle>
You gotta catch a bus or something?Stay a while and say the whole name.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:07"><subtitle>
Yeah, yeah, well, I'm not like that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:09"><subtitle>
I live in Los Angeles now,but you know what they say,you can take the girlout of the Greensboro-High Pointmetropolitan area, but you can't takethe Greensboro-High Pointmetropolitan area out of the girl.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:18"><subtitle>
I wish my boyfriend would've takenhis penis out of the girl.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:21"><subtitle>
-Meaning, I wish he would've pulled out.-Yeah, no, I got it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:25"><subtitle>
Thank you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:26"><subtitle>
Ooh, have I missed this!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:28"><subtitle>
I'm gonna eat the shitout of these hush puppies,and then tomorrow,I'm getting a real sausage biscuit,meaning a sausage patty,not that bullshit link situationthey call "sausage" in LA.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:05:47"><subtitle>
-Hello?-Princess Carolyn!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:49"><subtitle>
I just wanted to tell you what a ballI'm having on this crazy cop show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:53"><subtitle>
Glad to hear it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:54"><subtitle>
And my favorite star paidfor a food truck.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:57"><subtitle>
I don't know why Peter Scolari is buyingme a falafel plate,but, hey, I'm not complaining.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:01"><subtitle>
-Did you have a question?-Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:03"><subtitle>
So, I know my ex-wife isin the writers' room.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:06"><subtitle>
I don't want to make things weird for heror anybody else, so...do I have to do all the dialogue,as scripted,or can I have a little fun with it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:16"><subtitle>
-Um---Normally, I wouldn't even ask,but because of the whole ex-wifeof it all,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:20"><subtitle>
I figured I should just double-checkthat it's definitely okayif I change every single word.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:25"><subtitle>
Knowing Flip,I would just stick to the script.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:27"><subtitle>
So, don't flip the script?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:28"><subtitle>
-Exactly. Don't flip Flip's script.-That's a double-flip.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:31"><subtitle>
So, you're saying I should flip it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:33"><subtitle>
I'm saying the exact opposite.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:34"><subtitle>
-So, flip it. Flip it good.-Okay, I gotta go.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:37"><subtitle>
You're very funny and talented.Goodbye. Sorry. Show folk.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:41"><subtitle>
Well, this was a pleasure.Thanks for coming all this way.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:44"><subtitle>
I do hope to make a decision soon.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:46"><subtitle>
-Oh, you have to leave already?-Yeah, I gotta go set up my booth.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:49"><subtitle>
-Your booth?-At the flea market.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:50"><subtitle>
I sell clothes I bought cheapand then bedazzled.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:53"><subtitle>
I'm not saying I'm the Danville Targetor nothing,but it's good enough for fleas.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:56"><subtitle>
Okay, call me if you haveany other questions.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:58"><subtitle>
I always answer my phone,day or night.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:01"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:15"><subtitle>
Your mom's drunk again, isn't she?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:18"><subtitle>
My mom, well, obviously she was planningon cleaning the floors,but I asked her if I could do it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:22"><subtitle>
I wanna learn all the tricks of the trade,so one day,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:24"><subtitle>
I can be as good a housekeeperas she is.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:26"><subtitle>
Why do you still live here?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:29"><subtitle>
Why don't you go live with your daddown in Raleigh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:31"><subtitle>
All my sisters and brothers are gone.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:32"><subtitle>
If I leave, my mom's got nobody.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:34"><subtitle>
Besides, if I go,who's going to keep you out of trouble?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:38"><subtitle>
Did you know I'm on the football team?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:41"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description> I do know it.Are you ever gonna play?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:43"><subtitle>
Probably not, smart-ass.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:45"><subtitle>
Not unless the first-string quarterbackgets hurt.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:48"><subtitle>
Why aren't youthe first-string quarterback?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:50"><subtitle>
You're not evenfirst-string housekeeper!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:51"><subtitle>
Well, how about I first-string punch youin the nose?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:54"><subtitle>
Oh! Okay, easy, easy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:56"><subtitle>
Look, I think if I just keep my head downand be patient,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:59"><subtitle>
Coach will eventually realizeI should be QB one, you know?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:02"><subtitle>
That's a terrible approach.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:03"><subtitle>
You need to go after what you want.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:05"><subtitle>
You gotta fly into that sun,like Amelia Earhart did.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:08"><subtitle>
-What?-You know, like in the movie.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:10"><subtitle>
I never knew anybody who liked old moviesas much as you do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:13"><subtitle>
You're 18.You never knew anybody, period.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:16"><subtitle>
Okay, okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:17"><subtitle>
But what if I'm not as good a quarterbackas I think I am?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:21"><subtitle>
Doesn't matter.You don't need to be good enough.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:23"><subtitle>
You just need to convince your coachyou're good enough.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:25"><subtitle>
Damn! You know what?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:27"><subtitle>
-I'll talk to him tomorrow.-Don't leave until you get that yes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:31"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:35"><subtitle>
-Sadie, wait!-Oh. Um, hey.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:38"><subtitle>
Listen, I really want to spend more timegetting to know each other.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:41"><subtitle>
This baby, your baby,means everything to me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:44"><subtitle>
I think the more time we spend together,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:46"><subtitle>
-you'll realize I'm---<description>phone meowing</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:48"><subtitle>
-Do you need to take that?-No, it's fine. The perfect candidate.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:51"><subtitle>
I thought you always answered your phone,day or night.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:54"><subtitle>
Right. Hello?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:55"><subtitle>
I just got off the phone with Flip.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:57"><subtitle>
He's really excited aboutthis new motorcycle stunt he came up with.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:00"><subtitle>
-He wants to do it tomorrow, but---That's Flip, full of ideas. Gotta go.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:04"><subtitle>
Well, the show is already way over budgetand my boss is starting to ask questions.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:08"><subtitle>
Now, normally, I love questionsbecause they're good for pondering,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:12"><subtitle>
but I guess in the corporate world,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:14"><subtitle>
when people ask questions,they expect someone to answer them.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:17"><subtitle>
And, apparently,"Yeah, wow, it really makes you think,"is not the kind of answerthey're looking for.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:23"><subtitle>
Goodbye, Todd.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:24"><subtitle>
-Wait, one more thing.-What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:25"><subtitle>
Do you think Lake Erie ever gets jealousof Lake Superior?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:29"><subtitle>
Or is it, like, proud to be the eerie one?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:32"><subtitle>
We've been through this, Todd.Lakes don't have emotions.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:35"><subtitle>
What about Ricki Lake?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:36"><subtitle>
As I was saying, I'd love to spendmore time together, if you're up for it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:40"><subtitle>
You mentioned the flea market.I'd love to check it out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:43"><subtitle>
-Yeah, come by anytime tomorrow.-I thought it was today.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:45"><subtitle>
No, no. I just have to prep for it today.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:47"><subtitle>
But if you can stay another day,that would be awesome.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:50"><subtitle>
But only if you can. I know you're busy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:52"><subtitle>
I don't want me, or my baby,to get in the way of your career.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:31"><subtitle>
-Mom.-Let me tell you something.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:33"><subtitle>
Life is a big ol' roulette wheel.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:35"><subtitle>
Everyone's got a number.Some are winners, some aren't.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:38"><subtitle>
It all dependswhere the little white ball lands.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:40"><subtitle>
The problem is when peoplewith losing numbers think they're winners.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:44"><subtitle>
I don't know what you're talking about.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:46"><subtitle>
-Then what the hell are these?-College brochures. I--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:48"><subtitle>
You think you're goingto some fancy college in California,all the way on the other sideof the country from your mother?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:55"><subtitle>
-You're gonna abandon me?-Mom, it's not about you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:57"><subtitle>
UCLA?No, you will not see LA.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:01"><subtitle>
Even if you get into one of these places,how're you gonna pay for it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:05"><subtitle>
I'll get a job or a paid internship.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:07"><subtitle>
Well, la-di-da, I did not realizeI was in the presence of someone,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:11"><subtitle>
-who was gonna get a paid internship.-Mom, you need to go to bed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:15"><subtitle>
See, that's the differencebetween you and me, Princess Carolyn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:18"><subtitle>
I know where I belong.This is my bed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:22"><subtitle>

-Hello?-I thought you were gonna be here today.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:29"><subtitle>
-Where are you?-Something came up.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:31"><subtitle>
Okay, well, listen, Mr. Peanutbutter'sdoing all his own stunts,and every time he doesa dumb little somersault,everybody goes nutslike he's goddamn Kerri Strug.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:39"><subtitle>
Kerri Strug?You gotta update your references.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:41"><subtitle>
When the world seesthe likes of Kerri Strug, again,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:43"><subtitle>
I will adjust accordingly.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:45"><subtitle>
Anyway, I said I wanted to domy own stunts, too,but little did I knowthat Flip was writing a new scene,where a motorcycle falls offa five-story building.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:52"><subtitle>
Just say you don't want to do it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:54"><subtitle>
I cannot do thatbecause I already fired my stunt double,so I also need you to call himand get him back,and that might be tricky,'cause I was really brutal about it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:02"><subtitle>
-Why?-Because people were watching.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:04"><subtitle>
Now I need you to interveneand forbid me from doing my own stunts,even though I want to,because I actually don't want to,because that would require me to bein good shape, which we know I'm not,and also not a coward,which we both know I am.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:15"><subtitle>
-BoJack---Also, if you could say</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:16"><subtitle>
it's because I'm too important a starto take the risk on,but Mr. Peanutbutter can keep doinghis stuntsbecause he is less important;that would be real cool, thanks.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:24"><subtitle>
Fine, I'll handle it!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:25"><subtitle>
Just stop whining like a little bitch!</subtitle>

Sadie, you can sell anything,if you just sell people the ideathat they're not being sold to.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:06"><subtitle>
Wow!That's pretty manipulative.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:09"><subtitle>
But I didn't need tobecause your clothing sells itself.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:14:34"><subtitle>
-That boy's stuck with you, now.-Stuck with me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:38"><subtitle>
No, good stuck,like when you try onyour friend's fancy ringand it won't come off.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:43"><subtitle>
Now you got a free ring.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:44"><subtitle>
You know, Evelyn still expects youto give that ring back.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:46"><subtitle>
That sounds like an Evelyn problem.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:12"><subtitle>
Did you steal this from Evelyn, too?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:14"><subtitle>
Your... grammy gave me this necklacewhen I first got pregnant.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:18"><subtitle>
It's been in our family for generations.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:21"><subtitle>
It's from the old country.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:23"><subtitle>
And when you wear this,</subtitle>

I want you to remember that you've comefrom a long line of women,who've taken our licks,but we always land on our feet.</subtitle>
