Your mother's having another oneof her episodes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:30"><subtitle>
Last night, she went to see A Doll's Housewith a couple girlfriends,and now she has ideas.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:35"><subtitle>
I emerged from my sanctum, this afternoon,to discover that not only had shenot made me lunch,which is a meal I need in order to live,but she'd furthermore, locked herselfin the bedroom to weep... loudly.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:45"><subtitle>
Now, it's one thing for a woman to weep,but when they do it at such a volumeyou can hear it through the door,then you know they're doing itjust for the attention.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:53"><subtitle>
Anyway, I was able to cobble togethera sandwich for myself,so, I'm the real hero of the story.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:01:02"><subtitle>
It was a couple hours laterwhen I realized I was on a good runwith my novel.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:06"><subtitle>
I had this really interesting sentencethat kept going for pages and pages,and I thought about how rare it isto really get in the groove like that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:13"><subtitle>
How, most days, I can't concentratebecause my idiot childis blasting the television,and it suddenly dawned on me;hot cock on a rock,she never even picked upthe little noise and snot factory!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:23"><subtitle>
<description>tires screech, horn honking</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:26"><subtitle>
So, here I am, being your mother,which I know is giving you all sortsof mixed-up ideas about gender,while your brainis still loose and stupid.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:35"><subtitle>
Just remember,if you become a queer later in life,this isn't my fault!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:39"><subtitle>
Don't you sing no songs in your nightclubact called, "My Daddy was My Mommy,"while gazing longinglyat a tangled string of pearls.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:46"><subtitle>
Pearls are for ladies, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:49"><subtitle>
Pearls are for ladies.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:52"><subtitle>
You know Sunday is my writing day.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:54"><subtitle>
Sundays are the one daythat are just for me and my craft,and still, you and the black holethat birthed youconspire to ruin it for me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:02"><subtitle>
What am I supposed to do now?Just go back to writing?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:04"><subtitle>
I'm out of the zone now,the whole day's shot!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:07"><subtitle>
All because of youand that brittle wisp of a womanyou made the mistakeof making your mother.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:13"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description> No. It's not her fault.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:15"><subtitle>
She's doing the best she can, after all.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:17"><subtitle>
It's just that...you can't depend on women.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:20"><subtitle>
You can't depend on anyone.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:22"><subtitle>
Sooner or later, you need to learnthat no one elseis gonna take care of you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:25"><subtitle>
That's what I learnedwhen I had to make my own sandwich.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:28"><subtitle>
You can't rely on other people, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:30"><subtitle>
It's good for you to know that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:32"><subtitle>
And she's a good motherfor teaching you that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:34"><subtitle>
You've got a head start on most kids.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:37"><subtitle>
You're actually very lucky.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:41"><subtitle>
So, I stopped at a Jack in the Box,on the way here,and the girl behind the counter said,"Hiya! Are you having an awesome day?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:48"><subtitle>
Not, "How are you doing today?"No. "Are you having an awesome day?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:52"><subtitle>
Which is pretty shitty because it putsthe onus on me to disagree with her,like if I'm not having an "awesome day,"suddenly I'm the negative one.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:00"><subtitle>
Usually, when people ask how I'm doing,the real answer is I'm doing shitty,but I can't say I'm doing shittybecause I don't have a good reasonto be doing shitty.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:07"><subtitle>
So if I say, "I'm doing shitty,"then they say, "Why? What's wrong?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:10"><subtitle>
And I have to be like,"I don't know, all of it?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:13"><subtitle>
So instead, when people ask how I'm doing,I usually say, "I am doing so great."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:18"><subtitle>
But when this girl at the Jack in the Boxasked me if I was having an awesome day,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:22"><subtitle>
I thought, well, todayI'm actually allowed to feel shitty,today I have a good reason,so I said to her, "Well, my mom died."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:28"><subtitle>
And she immediately burst into tears.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:30"><subtitle>
So, now I have to comfort her,which is annoying,and meanwhile, there's a lineof people forming behind me,who are all giving methese real judgy looksbecause I madethe Jack in the Box girl cry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:39"><subtitle>
And she's bawling, and she's saying,"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,"and I'm like, "It's fine. It's fine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:44"><subtitle>
I mean, it's not fine,but, you know, it's... fine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:47"><subtitle>
And I would like to ordera Double Jack Meal,and I've kinda got somewhere to be,so maybe less with the cryingand more with the frying, huh?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:54"><subtitle>
<description>inhales</description> And the girl apologizes, again,and she offers me a free churrowith my meal.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:59"><subtitle>
And as I'm leaving,I think, "I just got a free churrobecause my mom died."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:04"><subtitle>
No one ever tells you when your mom dies,you get a free churro.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:07"><subtitle>
<description>people murmuring</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:10"><subtitle>
<description>clears throat</description> Anyway, I'm sorry,that's not part of the...<description>clears throat</description> All right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:14"><subtitle>
Okay, here we go. Let's do this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:16"><subtitle>
Here I am, BoJack Horseman,doing a eulogy, let's go.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:19"><subtitle>
Hey, piano man,can I get like a, like an organ flourish?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:22"><subtitle>
<description>organ plays</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:24"><subtitle>
Nicely done.You know, I was a little worried</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:26"><subtitle>
I wouldn't have the rightaccompaniment today.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:28"><subtitle>
I guess it's a good thing my momwas an organ donor!</subtitle>

Why don't you leavethe comedy to the professionals?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:36"><subtitle>
Okay? This is a funeral, sir,for my mother.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:38"><subtitle>
Can you show a little respect?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:40"><subtitle>
<description>trumpet whines</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:42"><subtitle>
I'll take it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:43"><subtitle>
Beatrice Horseman, who was she?What was her deal?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:46"><subtitle>
Well, she was a horse.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:47"><subtitle>
Uh, she was born in 1938.She died in 2018.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:50"><subtitle>
One time, she went to a parade,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:52"><subtitle>
and one time, she smokedan entire cigarette in one long inhale.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:55"><subtitle>
I watched her do it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:56"><subtitle>
Truly a remarkable woman.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:58"><subtitle>
<description>rustling</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:01"><subtitle>
Lived a full life, that lady.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:03"><subtitle>
Just, all the way to the end,which is, uh, now, I guess.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:08"><subtitle>
Really makes you think, though, huh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:10"><subtitle>
Life, right? Goes by, stuff happens.Then you die.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:15"><subtitle>
Well, that's my time,you've been great! Tip your waitress!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:17"><subtitle>
No, I'm just kidding around,there's no waitress.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:19"><subtitle>
That's all I have to say about my mother.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:21"><subtitle>
No point beating a dead horse, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:23"><subtitle>
So... <description>inhales</description> Now what?I don't know, Mom, you got any ideas?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:29"><subtitle>
Anything?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:30"><subtitle>
Mom?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:31"><subtitle>
No?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:32"><subtitle>
Nothing to contribute?Knock once if you're proud of me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:37"><subtitle>
Can I just say how amazing it isto be in a room with my mother,and I can just talk without her telling meto shut up and make her a drink?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:44"><subtitle>
Hey, Mom. Knock onceif you think I should shut up.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:46"><subtitle>
No? You sure?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:48"><subtitle>
I mean, I don't want to embarrass you,by making this eulogy into a me-logy,so, seriously,if you wanted me to sit downand let someone else talk, just knock.I will not be offended.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:57"><subtitle>
No? Your funeral.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:59"><subtitle>
Sorry about the closed casket, by the way.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:01"><subtitle>
She wanted an open casket,but, you know, she's dead now,so who cares what she wanted?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:06"><subtitle>
No, that sounds bad. I'm sorry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:07"><subtitle>
I think that if she could've seenwhat she looked like dead,she'd agree it's better this way.She looked like this.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:07:17"><subtitle>
Kinda like a pissed-off toy dinosaur.The coroner couldn't get her eyes closed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:21"><subtitle>
So, now her face is forever frozenin a mask of tremendous horrorand anguish.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:25"><subtitle>
Or as my mom called it, Tuesday!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:28"><subtitle>
Tuesday! My mom called it Tuesday.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:07:38"><subtitle>
<description>clears throat</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:39"><subtitle>
Here's a story.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:41"><subtitle>
When I was a teenager,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:42"><subtitle>
I performed a comedy routinefor my high school talent show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:46"><subtitle>
There was this cool jacketthat I wanted to wearbecause it would make melook like Albert Brooks.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:50"><subtitle>
For months, I saved up for this jacket,but when I finally had enough,I went to the store and it was gone.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:55"><subtitle>
They had just sold it to someone else.So, I went home and I told my mother.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:58"><subtitle>
She said, "Let that be a lesson.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:00"><subtitle>
That's the goodthat comes from wanting things."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:02"><subtitle>
She was really goodat dispensing life lessons,that always seemed to circle backto everything being my fault.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:08"><subtitle>
But then, on the day of the talent show,my mother had a surprise for me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:12"><subtitle>
She had bought me the jacket.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:13"><subtitle>
Even though she didn't know how to say it,I knew this meant that she loved me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:18"><subtitle>
Now, that's a good story about my mother.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:20"><subtitle>
It's not true,but it's a good story, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:22"><subtitle>
I stole it from an episode of Maude I sawwhen i was a kid,where she talks about her father.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:26"><subtitle>
I remember when I saw it,thinking that's the kind of story</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:29"><subtitle>
I want to tellabout my parents when they die.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:32"><subtitle>
But I don't have any stories like that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:34"><subtitle>
All I know about being goodI learned from TV.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:37"><subtitle>
And in TV, flawed charactersare constantly showing people they carewith these surprising grand gestures.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:42"><subtitle>
And I think that part of mestill believes that's what love is.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:46"><subtitle>
But in real life,the big gesture isn't enough.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:48"><subtitle>
You need to be consistent,you need to be dependably good.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:51"><subtitle>
You can't just screw everything up,and then take a boat out into the oceanto save your best friend,or solve a mystery, and fly to Kansas.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:57"><subtitle>
You need to do it every day,which is so... hard.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:01"><subtitle>
When you're a kid, you convince yourselfthat maybe the grand gesturecould be enough.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:06"><subtitle>
That even though your parentsaren't what you need them to be,over and over and over again,at any moment they might surprise you,with something... wonderful.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:15"><subtitle>
I kept waiting for that, the proof,that even though my motherwas a hard woman,deep down, she loved meand cared about meand wanted me to knowthat I made her lifea little bit brighter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:26"><subtitle>
Even now, I find myself waiting.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:30"><subtitle>
Hey, Mom, knock once if you love meand care about me,and want me to know I made your lifea little bit brighter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:35"><subtitle>
<description>owl chirping</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:38"><subtitle>
My mother did not go gentleinto that good night.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:41"><subtitle>
She went clawing and fightingand thrashing, hence the face.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:45"><subtitle>
-<description>groaning</description>-<description>mourners gasping</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:47"><subtitle>
If you'd seen her,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:48"><subtitle>
I swear to God the only thingyou'd be thinking about right nowis that I am nailing this impression.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:53"><subtitle>
-<description>woman clears her throat</description>-<description>chairs squeak</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:55"><subtitle>
I was in the hospital with herthose last moments,and they were truly horrifying,full of nonsensical screams and cries,but there was this moment,this one instant of strange calm,where she looked in my directionand said, "I see you."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:09"><subtitle>
That's the last thing she said to me."I see you."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:12"><subtitle>
Not a statement of judgmentor disappointment, just acceptanceand the simple recognitionof another person in a room.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:19"><subtitle>
"Hello, there. You are a person.And I see you."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:23"><subtitle>
Let me tell you,it's a weird thing to feelat 54 years old,that for the first time in your lifeyour mother sees you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:29"><subtitle>
It's an odd realization that it'sthe thing you've been missing,the only thing you wanted all along,to be seen.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:35"><subtitle>
And it doesn't feel like a relief,to finally be seen.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:37"><subtitle>
It feels mean, like,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:39"><subtitle>
"Oh, it turns out that you knewwhat I wanted,and you waited until the very last momentto give it to me."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:44"><subtitle>
I was prepared for more cruelty.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:46"><subtitle>
I was sure that she would getin one final zinger,about how I let her down,and about how I was fat and stupid,and too tall to bean effective Lindy-hopper.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:54"><subtitle>
How I was needy and a burdenand an embarrassment.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:58"><subtitle>
All that I was ready for.I was not ready for "I see you."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:03"><subtitle>
Only my mother would be lousy enoughto swipe mewith a moment of connectionon her way out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:08"><subtitle>
But maybe I'm giving her too much credit.Maybe it wasn't about connection.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:12"><subtitle>
Maybe it was a... Maybe it wasan "I see you," like, "I see you."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:17"><subtitle>
Like, "You might have the restof the world fooled,but I know exactly who you are."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:21"><subtitle>
That's more my mom's speed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:24"><subtitle>
Or maybe she just literally meant"I see you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:27"><subtitle>
You are an objectthat has entered my field of vision."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:31"><subtitle>
She was out of it at the end,so maybe it's dumbto try to attribute it to anything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:35"><subtitle>
-<description>woman sighs</description>-Back in the 90s,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:36"><subtitle>
I was in a very famous TV Showcalled Horsin' Around.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:40"><subtitle>
-<description>man coughs</description>-Please hold your applause.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:42"><subtitle>
And I remember one time, a fan asked me,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:44"><subtitle>
"Hey, um, you know that episodewhere the horse has to give Ethana pep talk,after Ethan finds out his crushonly asked him to the dancebecause her friends were havinga dorkiest date contest?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:54"><subtitle>
In all the shots of the horse,you can see a paper coffee cupon the kitchen counter,but in the shots of Ethan,the coffee cup's missing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:02"><subtitle>
Was that because the showwas making a statement,about the fluctuant subjectivity of memoryand how even two peoplecan experience the same momentin entirely different ways?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:12"><subtitle>
And I didn't have the heart to be, like,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:15"><subtitle>
"No, man, some crew guyjust left their coffee cup in the shot."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:19"><subtitle>
So instead, I was, like... "Yeah."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:23"><subtitle>
And maybe this is like that coffee cup.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:25"><subtitle>
Maybe, we're dumb to try to pinsignificance onto every little thing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:29"><subtitle>
Maybe, when someone says,"I see you," it just means, "I see you."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:34"><subtitle>
Then again, it's possibleshe wasn't even talking to me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:37"><subtitle>
Because, if I'm being honest,she wasn't really looking at me,she was looking past me.There was nobody else in the room.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:12:42"><subtitle>
I think she was talking to me,but, honestly,she was so far gone at that point,who knows what she was seeing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:47"><subtitle>
Who were you talking to, Mom?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:49"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:50"><subtitle>
Not saying, huh? Staying mum?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:53"><subtitle>
No rimshot there?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:54"><subtitle>
God, whatever I'm paying you,it's too much.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:57"><subtitle>
Maybe, she saw my dad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:59"><subtitle>
My dad died about ten years agoof injuries he sustained during a duel.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:03"><subtitle>
When your father dies,you ask yourself a lot of questions.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:06"><subtitle>
Questions like,"Wait, did you say he died in a duel?"and "Who dies in a duel?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:11"><subtitle>
The whole thing was so stupid.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:12"><subtitle>
Dad spent his entire lifewriting this book,but he couldn't get any storesto carry it,or any newspapers to review it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:19"><subtitle>
Finally, I guess this one newspaperthought he was pretty hilarious,because they ran a reviewand tore him to shreds.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:25"><subtitle>
So, my father, ever the Proud Mary,decided he would not standfor this besmirchment of his honor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:29"><subtitle>
He claimed the critic didn't understandwhat it meant to be a man,so he demanded satisfactionin the form of pistols at dawn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:36"><subtitle>
He wrote the paper, this letter,saying anyone who didn't like his book,he would challenge to a duel,anyone in the world.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:42"><subtitle>
He'd even pay for airfareto San Francisco and a night in a hotel.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:45"><subtitle>
Well, eventually this found its wayto some kook in Montana,who was as batshit as he wasand took him up on the offer.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:50"><subtitle>
They met at Golden Gate Park and agreed:ten paces, then shoot.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:54"><subtitle>
But in the middle of the ten paces,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:56"><subtitle>
Dad turned to ask the guy if he'd actuallyread the book and what he thought,but, not looking where he was going,tripped over an exposed rootand bashed his head on a rock.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:04"><subtitle>
<description>murmur</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:06"><subtitle>
I wish I'd known to goto Jack in the Box then.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:08"><subtitle>
I could have gotten a free churro.It would've been niceto have something to show for beingthe son of Butterscotch Horseman.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:14"><subtitle>
My darling mother gave the eulogy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:16"><subtitle>
My entire life I never heard her saya kind word to or about my father,but at his funeral she said,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:22"><subtitle>
"My husband is dead,and everything is worse now."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:25"><subtitle>
<description>clearing throat</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:26"><subtitle>
"My husband is dead,and everything is worse now."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:31"><subtitle>
I don't know why she said that.Maybe she felt that's the kind of thingyou're supposed to say at a funeral.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:35"><subtitle>
Maybe she hoped one daysomeone would say that about her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:38"><subtitle>
"My mother is dead,and everything is worse now."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:41"><subtitle>
Or maybe she knewthat he had frittered awayall her inheritance,and replaced it with crippling debt,which is a pretty shitty thingto leave your widow with.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:49"><subtitle>
"Bad news, you lost a husband,but don't worry, you also lost the house!"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:52"><subtitle>
Maybe Mom knew she'd have to sellall her fancy jewelryand move into a home.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:56"><subtitle>
Maybe that's what she meant by"everything is worse."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:58"><subtitle>
Is that what you meant, Mom?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:00"><subtitle>
I gotta say,I'm really carrying this double act.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:02"><subtitle>
At least with Penn and Teller,the quiet one does card tricks.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:05"><subtitle>
Hey, piano man,when I say something funny to my mom,how about you give me a rimshot?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:09"><subtitle>
-<description>rimshot plays</description>-Yeah, but not now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:11"><subtitle>
When I say something funny. Like, okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:14"><subtitle>
What's the difference between my motherand a disruptive expulsion of germs?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:17"><subtitle>
One's a coughin' fitand the other fits a coffin!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:21"><subtitle>
-That's an example of a funny thing.-<description>rimshot plays</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:24"><subtitle>
Thank you. Let's try again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:25"><subtitle>
Hey, Mom. What's the difference betweenmy mother and a bunch of Easter eggs?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:28"><subtitle>
One gets carried in a basket,the other gets buried in a casket!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:33"><subtitle>
-<description>rimshot plays</description>-Ready for one more? Last one.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:35"><subtitle>
What's the differencebetween a first-year lit majorand my mother, Beatrice Horseman?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:39"><subtitle>
One is decently read,and the other's a huge bitch!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:44"><subtitle>
-<description>woman gasps</description>-<description>murmers</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:45"><subtitle>
Might have gone a little too farwith that one.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:47"><subtitle>
That one might have been a little too"my mom's a huge bitch" for the room.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:51"><subtitle>
I'm sorry, Mother.You're not a huge bitch.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:53"><subtitle>
You were a huge bitch...and now you're dead.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:57"><subtitle>
<description>woman sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:58"><subtitle>
You know, the first time I ever performedin front of an audience,it actually was, uh, with my mom.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:03"><subtitle>
She used to put on these shows,with her supper club in the living room,and she used to make... <description>inhales</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:07"><subtitle>
She used to make me sing"The Lollipop Song."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:10"><subtitle>
<description>organ playing tune</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:13"><subtitle>
Those parties, they were really something.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:14"><subtitle>
There were skits and magic acts,and ethnically insensitivevaudeville routines,and the big finalewas always a dance my mother did.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:24"><subtitle>
She had this beautiful dress that she onlybrought out for these parties,and she did this incredible number.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:29"><subtitle>
It was so beautiful and sad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:33"><subtitle>
Dad hated the parties.He'd lock himself in the study,and bang on the wallsfor us to keep it down,but he always came out to see Mom dance.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:42"><subtitle>
He'd linger in the doorway,scotch in hand,and watch in awe, as this cynical,despicable woman he married...took flight.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:52"><subtitle>
And as a child who was completelyterrified of both my parents,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:56"><subtitle>
I was always awarethat this moment of grace,it meant something.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:02"><subtitle>
We understood each other, in a way.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:03"><subtitle>
Me and my mom and my dad,as screwed up as we all were,we did understand each other.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:09"><subtitle>
My mother, she knewwhat it's like to feel your entire lifelike you're drowningwith the exception of these moments,these very rare, brief instances,in which you suddenly remember...you can swim.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:22"><subtitle>
<description>flashback</description></subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:17:27"><subtitle>
<description>classical music playing</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:38"><subtitle>
But, then again, mostly not.Mostly you're drowning.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:42"><subtitle>
She understood that too.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:43"><subtitle>
And she recognized that I understood it.And Dad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:46"><subtitle>
All three of us were drowning,and we didn't know how to save each other,but there was an understandingthat we were all drowning together.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:53"><subtitle>
I would like to thinkthat's what she meantwhen we were in the hospitaland she said, "I see you."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:57"><subtitle>
The weird thingabout both your parents being deadis it means that you're next.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:02"><subtitle>
I mean, you know, obviously it's notlike there's a wait list for dying.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:05"><subtitle>
Any one of us could get run overby a Snapchatting teen at any moment.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:08"><subtitle>
And you would think that knowing thatwould make us more adventurous,and kind, and forgiving.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:13"><subtitle>
But it makes us small,and stupid, and petty.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:18"><subtitle>
I actually had a near-death experience,recently.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:20"><subtitle>
A stunt went badand I fell off a building.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:23"><subtitle>
I'm an actor. I do my own stunts.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:25"><subtitle>
I'm on this new show Philbert.I'm Philbert. Star of the show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:29"><subtitle>
It hasn't come out yet,but it's already getting Emmy buzz.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:31"><subtitle>
Oh, speaking of buzz...<description>inhales</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:33"><subtitle>
I've to taketwo of these every morning,but my days are so screwed up'cause of the shooting schedule,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:38"><subtitle>
I don't even knowwhat morning means anymore.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:40"><subtitle>
There's a joke in there somewhere,about a guywho's been to so many funerals,he doesn't even knowwhat mourning means anymore.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:46"><subtitle>
Let you guys figure that one outfor yourselves. <description>gulps</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:49"><subtitle>
Anyway, you know what I thought...when I was falling off the buildingand I went into panic mode?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:54"><subtitle>
The last thing that my stupid braincould come up with before I died?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:59"><subtitle>
"Won't they be sorry."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:02"><subtitle>
-Cool thought, brain.-<description>rimshot plays</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:03"><subtitle>
No, that wasn't...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:04"><subtitle>
Would you just... Dial it back, all right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:06"><subtitle>
I don't even know what "they"I wanted to be sorry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:09"><subtitle>
My mom, even before she died,could barely remember who I was.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:12"><subtitle>
And of course, my dad's dead.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:14"><subtitle>
The last conversation I ever had with himwas about his novel.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:17"><subtitle>
He was so certainthis book was his legacy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:19"><subtitle>
Maybe he thought it would vindicate himfor all the shitty things he ever didin his stupid worthless life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:25"><subtitle>
Maybe it did. I don't know.I never read it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:27"><subtitle>
Because why would I give him that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:30"><subtitle>
I used to be on this TV showcalled Horsin' Around.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:33"><subtitle>
Seriously, hold your applause.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:35"><subtitle>
-<description>man coughs</description>-Well held.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:37"><subtitle>
It was written by my friend Herb Kazzaz,who's also dead now,and it starred this little girlnamed Sarah Lynn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:43"><subtitle>
And it was about these orphans.And early on, the network had a note,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:46"><subtitle>
"Maybe don't mentionthey're orphans,because audiences tendto find orphans sad and not relatable."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:52"><subtitle>
I never thought the orphans were sad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:53"><subtitle>
I always thought they were luckybecause they could imagine their parentsto be anything they wanted.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:59"><subtitle>
They had something to long for.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:01"><subtitle>
Anyway, we did this one season finale,where Olivia's birth mother comes to town.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:04"><subtitle>
And she was a junkie,but she's gotten herself cleaned up,and she wants to bein Olivia's life again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:09"><subtitle>
And of course, she's like a perfectgrown-up version of Olivia,and they go to the mall togetherand get her ears pierced,like she's always wanted and--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:16"><subtitle>
Sorry, spoiler alert for the season sixfinale of Horsin' Around,if you're still workingyour way through it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:22"><subtitle>
Anyway, the horse triesto warn her, "Be careful,moms have a way of letting you down."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:26"><subtitle>
But Olivia just thinksthe horse is jealous,and when the mom saysshe's moving to California,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:32"><subtitle>
Olivia decides to go with her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:34"><subtitle>
And the network really juicedthe cliffhanger:</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:36"><subtitle>
''Is Olivia gone for good?''</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:39"><subtitle>
But of course, because it's a TV show,she was not gone for good.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:41"><subtitle>
Of course, because it's a TV show,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:43"><subtitle>
Olivia's mother had a relapseand had to go back to rehab,so Olivia had to hitchhikeall the way home,getting rides from Mr. T,Alf, and the cast of Stomp.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:52"><subtitle>
Of course that's what happened.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:53"><subtitle>
Because, what are you gonna do,just not have Olivia on the show?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:57"><subtitle>
You can't have happy endings in sitcoms,not really,because, if everyone's happy,the show would be over,and above all else,the show... has to keep going.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:06"><subtitle>
There's always more show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:08"><subtitle>
And you can call Horsin' Around dumb,or bad, or unrealistic,but there is nothing more realisticthan that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:14"><subtitle>
You never get a happy ending,'cause there's always more show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:19"><subtitle>
I guess until there isn't.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:21"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:23"><subtitle>
My mom would hate it if she knewthat I spent so much time at her funeraltalking about my old TV show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:29"><subtitle>
Or maybe she'd think it was funnythat her idiot soncouldn't even do this right. Who knows?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:33"><subtitle>
She left no instructionsfor what she wanted me to say.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:36"><subtitle>
All I know is she wanted an open casket,and her idiot soncouldn't even do that right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:41"><subtitle>
I'll stand up here and pretend</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:43"><subtitle>
I understoodhow to please that woman,even though so much of my life has beenwasted in vain attempts to figure it out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:48"><subtitle>
But I keep going back to that momentin the ICU when she looked at me, and...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:52"><subtitle>
"I-C-U."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:54"><subtitle>
"I... see... you."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:59"><subtitle>
Jesus Christ,we were in the intensive care unit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:03"><subtitle>
She was just reading a sign.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:07"><subtitle>
My mom died and all I gotwas this free churro.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:12"><subtitle>
You know the shittiest thingabout all of this?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:14"><subtitle>
Is when that stranger behind the countergave me that free churro,that small act of kindnessshowed more compassionthan my mother gave meher entire goddamn life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:23"><subtitle>
Like, how hard is it to do something nicefor a person?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:26"><subtitle>
This woman at the Jack in the Boxdidn't even know me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:30"><subtitle>
I'm your son.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:31"><subtitle>
All I had was you!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:35"><subtitle>
<description>inhales</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:37"><subtitle>
I have this friend.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:38"><subtitle>
And right around when I first met her,her dad died, and I actually went with herto the funeral.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:44"><subtitle>
And months later, she told methat she didn't understandwhy she was still upset,because she never even liked her father.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:51"><subtitle>
It made sense to me, because I wentthrough the same thing when my dad died.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:54"><subtitle>
And I'm going through the same thing now.You know what it's like?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:57"><subtitle>
It's like that show Becker,you know, with Ted Danson?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:59"><subtitle>
I watched the entire run of it,hoping that it would get better,and it never did.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:04"><subtitle>
It had all the right pieces, but it just--It couldn't put them together.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:06"><subtitle>
And when it got canceled,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:07"><subtitle>
I was really bummed out,not because I liked the show,but because I knew it could beso much better,and now it never would be.And that's what losing a parent is like.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:17"><subtitle>
It's like Becker.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:19"><subtitle>
Suddenly, you realize you'll never havethe good relationship you wanted,and as long as they were alive,even though you'd never admit it,part of you,the stupidest goddamn part of you,was still holding on to that chance.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:33"><subtitle>
And you didn't even realize ituntil that chance went away.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:36"><subtitle>
"My mother is dead,and everything is worse now."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:41"><subtitle>
Because now I knowI will never have a motherwho looks at me from across a roomand says,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:46"><subtitle>
"BoJack Horseman, I see you."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:50"><subtitle>
But I guess it's good to know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:52"><subtitle>
It's good to knowthat there is nobody looking out for me,that there never was,and there never will be.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:58"><subtitle>
No, it's good to know that I amthe only one that I can depend on.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:01"><subtitle>
And I know that now and it's good.It's good that I know that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:05"><subtitle>
So... it's good my mother is dead.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:08"><subtitle>
<description>gulps, sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:10"><subtitle>
Well. No point beating a dead horse.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:12"><subtitle>
Beatrice Horseman was born in 1938,and she died in 2018,and I have no idea... what she wanted.</subtitle>
