-<description>writing</description>-<description>Indira</description> So, it all started on Monday.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:59"><subtitle>
I was in a session with Diane--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:01"><subtitle>
...a! Diana.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:02"><subtitle>
<description>Mary-Beth</description> Like Diana,Princess of Whales?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:04"><subtitle>
<description>Indira</description> Exactly.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:06"><subtitle>
It's just so toughbeing Princess of Whales.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:08"><subtitle>
Like, I can't be all things to all whales.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:10"><subtitle>
-You're deflecting.-I'm not!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:11"><subtitle>
Let's talk about the BoBo tape.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:13"><subtitle>
What's the BoBo tape?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:14"><subtitle>
She recently came into possessionof an audiotape</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:17"><subtitle>
of her friend and co-worker,BoBo, the Angsty Zebra.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:20"><subtitle>
<description>BoBo</description> On the boat. There was a girl.In New Mexico.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:25"><subtitle>
And she trusted me. Also, I'm a zebra.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:28"><subtitle>
-What girl is he talking about?-I don't know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:31"><subtitle>
"Girl" sounds young, right? <description>scoffs</description>Whatever it is, it's gotta be bad,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:35"><subtitle>
because, otherwise,why wouldn't he tell me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:38"><subtitle>
Diana, you are not responsiblefor the dysfunction of others.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:41"><subtitle>
I actually explore this in my book,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:43"><subtitle>
Are You ResponsibleFor The Dysfunction of Others?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:45"><subtitle>
Spoiler alert: You're not!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:46"><subtitle>
I just wish I could talk to him about it,but he's like an open sore.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:50"><subtitle>
Attention! As some of youmight have heard, my mom died recently.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:54"><subtitle>
I know you're very concerned,but I wanna let you knowit will not affect my work.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:57"><subtitle>
I'm here, and I'm doing fine.I just want to focus on the show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:01"><subtitle>
So, please treat this like any other day,and be extra-nice to me</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:04"><subtitle>
because I am a famous actor,not because my mom died.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:08"><subtitle>
<description>all murmuring</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:10"><subtitle>
Thank you. Good.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:11"><subtitle>
Yes, that's what I'm looking for.Just go about your business.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:14"><subtitle>
That's good 'cause I don't want to talkabout my mom.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:17"><subtitle>
Hmm. <description>grunts</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:19"><subtitle>
-Hey. Did you hear my mom died?-Yeah. But you don't wanna talk about it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:23"><subtitle>
No. Pretty weird she died, though, huh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:25"><subtitle>
-Do you want to talk about it?-No. I'm just saying it's weird.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:28"><subtitle>
-BoBo. I am so sorry.-And I so don't wanna talk about it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:32"><subtitle>
Obsessed with my mom much?You're the one with issues.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:35"><subtitle>
Uh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:36"><subtitle>
I feel like he wants me to comfort him,but I'm still angry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:39"><subtitle>
Maybe you could both use some spacefrom each other.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:42"><subtitle>
Why don't you tell him you needto focus on your work?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:44"><subtitle>
What work?Flippy won't let me do anything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:46"><subtitle>
<description>dolphin voice</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:49"><subtitle>
Flippy? Are you okay?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:51"><subtitle>
<description>squeaking</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:57"><subtitle>
Hey, what are we filming today?Why is there a submarine set?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:01"><subtitle>
<description>squeaking continues</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:02"><subtitle>
<description>Diana</description> Interior sub?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:07"><subtitle>
Why didn't you just write "way"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:11"><subtitle>
Okay. So, now we just needto come up with a scenethat takes place in a submarine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:22"><subtitle>
Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:25"><subtitle>
-Ah!-Did you hear my mom died?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:28"><subtitle>
<description>Indira</description> How about this?If he wants to talk,and you aren't can't confront him,tell him your therapist saysyou need space.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:34"><subtitle>
That's where I went wrong.I inserted myself into her story.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:37"><subtitle>
Don't beat yourself up.Remember what Doctor Janet said?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:41"><subtitle>
<description>bells in accordance to stick</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:44"><subtitle>
Tell me about your day.You had a tough workplace mediation?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:47"><subtitle>
Whoo! The problem with these twois they don't just work together.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:51"><subtitle>
They also live together.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:53"><subtitle>
<description>grunting</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:56"><subtitle>
What a beautiful morning!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:57"><subtitle>
<description>Indira</description> Wait, wait,, wait. Hold on.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:59"><subtitle>
If your story can have Princess Diana,why can't mine have Emperor Finger-Face?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:03"><subtitle>
It's not actually Princess Diana.She's just named Diana.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:06"><subtitle>
I've been picturing Princess Diana.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:08"><subtitle>
Okay, fine. Tell me what happenedwith Emperor Finger-Face.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:12"><subtitle>
He lived in the same apartmentas a Tangled Fog of Pulsating Yearningin the shape of a woman.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:18"><subtitle>
Good morning, Emperor Finger-Face!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:20"><subtitle>
Good morning to you,Tangled Fog of Pulsating Yearning!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:24"><subtitle>
-See you tonight?-Afternoon.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:25"><subtitle>
I wanna talk to you,so I set a meeting through your assistant.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:28"><subtitle>
-Have you seen my keys?-Butter tray in the fridge.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:31"><subtitle>
I think I put them thereduring one of my night terrors.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:34"><subtitle>
I don't have time to go to the kitchen.I'll just hotwire my car.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:37"><subtitle>
-Hey, did you eat breakfast?-No time for meals.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:40"><subtitle>
I just grab whatever I can,whenever I can.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:42"><subtitle>
Hold on.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:43"><subtitle>
I know you're a gal on the go,but even tangled fogs of pulsatingyearning need to eat right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:48"><subtitle>
I'll get something on set.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:50"><subtitle>
Pinky swear? <description>horn</description> Ow! I poked my face!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:53"><subtitle>
I feel I'm having a hard timefollowing the storybecause of how weirdyou made the characters.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:57"><subtitle>
The important thing is that these twohave been living togetherfor almost a year with virtually no drama.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:02"><subtitle>
In some ways, it's the most functionalrelationship either have ever been in!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:06"><subtitle>
Oh, okay. I guess that's not that weird.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:08"><subtitle>
Great! Now, back to the storyof the fog and the hand!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:11"><subtitle>
-So. What can I do you for?-I have no workspace on set.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:14"><subtitle>
I was hoping we could allocate some moneyto get me an office.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:18"><subtitle>
Oh, look, here's the exact paperworkyou need all filled out and ready to go.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:22"><subtitle>
-Okay.-Just needs your signature.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:24"><subtitle>
-Let me retrieve my pen.-Marvelous!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:26"><subtitle>
Yep, I am currently gripping my peninside my jacket.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:30"><subtitle>
Now to just pull it outand sign this document.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:34"><subtitle>
Just goes to show,you get what you needif you pull the right strings.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:38"><subtitle>
Strings?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:39"><subtitle>
-<description>gasps</description> It was you!-What was me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:41"><subtitle>
The last string cheese in the apartment,I was saving it. And you took it!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:46"><subtitle>
And now you want me to give you an office?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:48"><subtitle>
What?! I didn't take your cheese.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:50"><subtitle>
Uh-oh, are we havinga work-related conflict?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:54"><subtitle>
This feels like more of ayou-crashing-on-my-couch-related conflict.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:58"><subtitle>
When I started here,I signed a contract that said,all intra-office disputesmust be resolved via mediation,or failing that, forced arbitration.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:09"><subtitle>
Ugh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:10"><subtitle>
So, then I-- You're not eating.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:12"><subtitle>
I just-- I keep thinkingabout BoBo the Zebra.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:15"><subtitle>
Okay, what happened next with BoBo?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:18"><subtitle>
Well, he wanted to get back to work,but since Flippy had writer's block,there was nothing for the actors to do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:23"><subtitle>
How is there nothing to shoot?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:24"><subtitle>
So, what, I just have to wait around,and be alone with my thoughts? Gross.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:28"><subtitle>
When I was on The Murder-Stoppers.we had to shut down productionbecause Nick Nolte wouldn't come outof his trailer.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:33"><subtitle>
He wasn't even on the show!He was in one of our trailers,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:35"><subtitle>
-and we couldn't get him out!-Is it hard to write a script, Gino?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:38"><subtitle>
"Oh, I'm Philbert, bang, bang.I'm a tough guy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:40"><subtitle>
My wife is dead! Did I kill her?Who knows? I'm cool."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:43"><subtitle>
That was pretty good.Can we just roll on that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:45"><subtitle>
When there's something to shoot,we'll shoot.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:47"><subtitle>
Meanwhile, you wanna go bang one outin your trailer? I'll get my diaphragm.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:50"><subtitle>
Nah, I'd just be thinking aboutmy dead mom the whole time,which would either ruin it or--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:54"><subtitle>
Oh, God, what if it makes it better?I don't wanna know that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:56"><subtitle>
-You want me to just get you some pie?-No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:59"><subtitle>
-Yes.-Okay, big guy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:01"><subtitle>
<description>BoBo sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:02"><subtitle>
-<description>sympathetic voice</description> Hey, buddy.-Hey, Mr. Chocolate-Hazelnut-Spread.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:05"><subtitle>
Really sorry about your mom.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:07"><subtitle>
No, it's fine. I'm fine. It's really fine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:09"><subtitle>
It must be so hard to lose a loved one.I, for one, never have.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:13"><subtitle>
You've never lost a loved one?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:14"><subtitle>
-When my mom got old, she moved to a farm.-What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:17"><subtitle>
In the country, where she could haveplenty of room to run free.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:19"><subtitle>
Why would she wanna run aroundif she's old?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:21"><subtitle>
You know,I never really questioned the logic.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:23"><subtitle>
My brother set it up.I haven't been able to visit,but everyone in my familygoes to that farm eventually.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:28"><subtitle>
-Oh, dude, your mom's dead.-What? No. She's at a farm.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:32"><subtitle>
After a prolonged bout of Parkinson's.A farm.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:34"><subtitle>
Where they don't have telephones,or the internet, and... Oh, my God.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:37"><subtitle>
She's dead. My mom is dead!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:39"><subtitle>
-<description>sobbing</description>-Whoa!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:41"><subtitle>
<description>BoBo groans</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:42"><subtitle>
Oh, there... There, there.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:43"><subtitle>
<description>Flippy squeaking</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:44"><subtitle>
-What's going on with this submarine?-My therapist doesn't want metalking to you!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:48"><subtitle>
-What?-My therapist, Dr. Indira,says it would be goodif you gave me some space.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:53"><subtitle>
-Why would she say that?-Don't know. I'm just the client.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:56"><subtitle>
-Her call, not mine. I should go.-Uh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:58"><subtitle>
Everybody? My dear motherhas transcended this plane.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:02"><subtitle>
-<description>all</description> Aw.-I am incredibly fragileand could use all the support I can get,so if everyone could paya lot of attention to me,and ask me a lot of questionsabout my mother,and maybe tell me storiesabout your mothers,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:12"><subtitle>
I think that would really make mefeel a lot better.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:14"><subtitle>
Sure, Mr. Chocolate-Hazelnut-Spread!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:16"><subtitle>
-<description>man</description> So sorry for your loss.-This is a very healthy way to grieve.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:19"><subtitle>
-<description>applause</description>-Ugh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:22"><subtitle>
So, a brief recapitulation:this is not a roomfor repudiation or condemnationover string cheeseappropriation accusations.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:30"><subtitle>
Mediation is an invitationfor open conversation,frustration de-escalation,and exchange of information,which, in summation,removes any justification for litigationinvolving this corporation.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:43"><subtitle>
Nobody was going to litigate anything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:45"><subtitle>
That's fabulous,because you legally cannot.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:48"><subtitle>
Now, tell me about your journeyinto the woods of conflict.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:51"><subtitle>
Well, this very Wednesday, October 24th,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:55"><subtitle>
I was excited to come hometo some string cheese. The very last one.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:59"><subtitle>
I'd been saving it all week.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:01"><subtitle>
-All week until Wednesday?-That is correct.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:04"><subtitle>
I measure my weeks Thursday to Wednesday.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:06"><subtitle>
-Why would you---Tangled Fog of Pulsating Yearning?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:08"><subtitle>
Emperor Finger-Face has the floor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:10"><subtitle>
I was gonna melt it downand then sculpt itinto a Mozzarella Cinderella!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:14"><subtitle>
But when I got home,my string cheese was gone!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:18"><subtitle>
Doesn't mean I took it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:19"><subtitle>
Tangled Fog, watch yourself.Or I'll turn on this fan.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:21"><subtitle>
Well, this morning you said yourselfthat when it comes to eating,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:25"><subtitle>
-you just grab whatever you can.-Can we use "I" statements?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:29"><subtitle>
<description>shouts</description> Ai, ai, ai! You took my cheese!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:31"><subtitle>
You probably ate it yourselfduring one of your night terrors!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:34"><subtitle>
We know you opened the fridge.You put my keys in there.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:36"><subtitle>
I can't eat while I'm terrified.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:38"><subtitle>
That's why I'll never knowthe delicious crunch of Count Chocula.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:42"><subtitle>
-<description>shudders</description>-That still doesn't mean I took it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:44"><subtitle>
-You will both have a chance to---Come on!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:46"><subtitle>
We both know you drift aroundthe apartment like you own the place.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:50"><subtitle>
-It's my apartment!-<description>shouts and thumps</description> And it's my cheese!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:53"><subtitle>
Oh, boy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:54"><subtitle>
<description>tires screech</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:56"><subtitle>
-<description>grunts</description> Who do you think you are?-<description>gasps</description> Uh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:58"><subtitle>
-I'm Dr. Indir---I know who you are!</subtitle>

You know how many therapiststhere are named Indira?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:02"><subtitle>
Google filled in your last name for me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:05"><subtitle>
Why did you tell Dianathat she needed space from me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:07"><subtitle>
Would you like to have a seat?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:08"><subtitle>
No, I don't wanna "have a seat,"and here's why.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:11"><subtitle>
Therapists are manipulative leeches...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:16"><subtitle>
So, when Jerry Lewismistook me for the valet,he was carrying so much painI could never fathom.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:22"><subtitle>
-Mm...-And that realizationallows me to forgive.Not for his sake, but for mine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:28"><subtitle>
-Mm-hmm.-Wow. How long was I talking?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:30"><subtitle>
I hope that was cathartic for you.You wanna come back same time tomorrow?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:33"><subtitle>
Wait a minute, I see what's going on here.Are you... my new best friend?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:38"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description> Uh...?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:40"><subtitle>
Ugh, I'm sorry, I feel like I'm hoggingall the conversation.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:44"><subtitle>
There's definitely more to your storythan mine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:46"><subtitle>
Mine's more like a secondary story.A B-story, if you will.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:50"><subtitle>
I have a feeling it will continueto offer a light alternative,as my story gets increasingly serious.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:54"><subtitle>
Let's continue to switch back and forthbetween our stories,pausing at their most interesting moments.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:59"><subtitle>
That feels like the most natural wayto have a conversation.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:02"><subtitle>
Well, while I was talking to BoBo,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:04"><subtitle>
Diana was trying to keep things together</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:06"><subtitle>
-on set.-I thought it was my turn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:07"><subtitle>
-<description>gasps</description> Oh, my God! Oh, my God.-<description>Diana</description> Okay, cut?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:11"><subtitle>
-<description>buzzer blares</description>-Why is Sassy saying "Oh, my God?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:14"><subtitle>
I just figured,we've got all these people here,we might as well film some stuff.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:17"><subtitle>
Presumably something shocking will happen,and then if it does,we have a shot of you saying,<description>mimics Gino</description> "Oh, my God!"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:23"><subtitle>
-Makes sense.-Diana, can I talk to you for a sec?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:25"><subtitle>
I know you're going through something,and need boundaries,but this isn't personal,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:29"><subtitle>
-it's about the show.-Ah!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:30"><subtitle>
<description>Diana grunts, sighs</description> What is it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:32"><subtitle>
I lied. It's a 100% personal.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:33"><subtitle>
-What?-But it's good! You're gonna like this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:35"><subtitle>
-Remember you said you needed space?-Yes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:37"><subtitle>
When you told me that,I didn't take it well.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:39"><subtitle>
-Uh...-But I made a new friend,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:40"><subtitle>
-so everything is good now.-Oh. Well, that's great.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:43"><subtitle>
I'm glad you think so because, fun twist,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:45"><subtitle>
-it's Dr. Indira.-What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:46"><subtitle>
I'm seeing Dr. Indira now, as a friend.Dr. Indira's my new friend.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:49"><subtitle>
-No.-What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:50"><subtitle>
It's great that you would wanna talkto someone, and you should!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:53"><subtitle>
But she's mine.I really need her to just be mine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:56"><subtitle>
-Can you understand that?-<description>sighs</description> Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:01"><subtitle>
Diana asked me not to be friends with you,so out of respect for her,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:05"><subtitle>
I think it's best that I continueseeing you behind her back.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:10"><subtitle>
We can still do our lunchtime hang outs,but to cover our tracks,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:13"><subtitle>
I'll compensate youfor your time on the books.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:15"><subtitle>
Ιt'll seem as if you have a client.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:16"><subtitle>
And, to be safe, we should invokea therapist-to-friend confidentiality.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:19"><subtitle>
How's that sound?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:23"><subtitle>
So, in my dreams, I'm Philbert,and sometimes when I wake up,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:26"><subtitle>
I don't know if I'm Philbert or if I'm me,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:28"><subtitle>
-or if I'm still dreaming.-<description>watch beeping</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:30"><subtitle>
Oh, that's our time of friendship hour.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:33"><subtitle>
I'm just so glad that I can help break upyour day of listening to whiny babieswith some entertaining lunchtime convo.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:39"><subtitle>
Should I have told himwhat we were doing was therapy?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:41"><subtitle>
On some level, he must have knownwhat was going on.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:44"><subtitle>
What I don't understand is,if you knew Diana asked himnot to see you--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:47"><subtitle>
I'm a therapist. A doctor heals.A DJ spins.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:51"><subtitle>
Jessica Chastain takes whatever gigAmy Adams says no to.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:54"><subtitle>
My job is to listen.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:56"><subtitle>
And at that moment,BoBo needed someone to listen.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:58"><subtitle>
I know the feeling.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:59"><subtitle>
Okay, we've been going back and forthfor two hours.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:03"><subtitle>
Can we take a break?I gotta use the bathroom. If I even can!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:06"><subtitle>
Maybe it's just another hand down there!Guess I'll find out!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:10"><subtitle>
Why not just say you took the cheese?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:12"><subtitle>
-Because I didn't.-You want an office, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:14"><subtitle>
There's nothing wrong with tellinga small lie to avoid a fight.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:18"><subtitle>
I do it all the time with my wife,Doctor, uh, Underwear.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:22"><subtitle>
-Heh?-I love your new hairstyle, honey.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:25"><subtitle>
-Did you not like my new hairstyle?-Oh! Um... Back to my story...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:30"><subtitle>
All you have to dois tell Emperor Finger-Facewhat he wants to hear.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:34"><subtitle>
Fifty-nine cents worth of edible stringfor a brand-new office?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:37"><subtitle>
Wouldn't you take that deal?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:39"><subtitle>
So, turns out I can use the bathroom,but it comes out in tiny cubes!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:44"><subtitle>
Hey. I took the string cheese.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:46"><subtitle>
Ha, ha! I knew it!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:48"><subtitle>
Wonderful. So, she can replace the cheeseand you'll give her an office. We did it!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:52"><subtitle>
Great! Let me just grab my pen.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:54"><subtitle>
-But even if I did take the cheese---Which you just admitted you did!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:59"><subtitle>
Would I be in the wrong?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:00"><subtitle>
I mean, it is kind of a "fair game food,"don't you think?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:03"><subtitle>
-What?-It's not like it's a sandwich.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:05"><subtitle>
Some foods are just widely understoodto be up for grabs.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:07"><subtitle>
-No. You guys.-<description>Finger-Face</description> Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:09"><subtitle>
Well, then let's make a listof fair game foods.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:12"><subtitle>
Grapes. Fair game. Eggs. Fair game.An unsliced pie. Not fair game.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:17"><subtitle>
A sliced pie. Fair game.The last slice. Not fair game.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:22"><subtitle>
Then let's also make a listof what's fair game to me in my apartment.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:25"><subtitle>
Oh, that's right, everything,you literal knucklehead.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:28"><subtitle>
Oh, ho-ho!That's a solid diss coming from a gas.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:33"><subtitle>
Please, you two,we can still reach an agreement.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:35"><subtitle>
I don't know. I think this might gobeyond simple mediation.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:38"><subtitle>
-No!-Damn it, we're going to arbitration!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:41"><subtitle>
<description>shouts</description> Nooooooooooo!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:44"><subtitle>
Hey, Flippy. I got everyone saying,"Oh, my God." How's it going in here?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:49"><subtitle>
"Interior sub. Philbert. Philbert.Flap, flap, flippy, flap. Fart. Barf.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:55"><subtitle>
Barf me a river, fartbag."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:56"><subtitle>
<description>squeaking</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:58"><subtitle>
What's going on in here?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:00"><subtitle>
<description>squeaking continues</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:03"><subtitle>
If it relieves any pressure,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:05"><subtitle>
I don't know that everyone thinksyou're a brilliant genius.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:09"><subtitle>
I think we need to simplify.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:10"><subtitle>
Let's start with Fritz.Is he a ghost or is he not a ghost?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:14"><subtitle>
Can't he just be a ghost?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:17"><subtitle>
So, why is Philbert seeing a ghost?Maybe he feels haunted?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:22"><subtitle>
And Fritz represents that?What is haunting Philbert?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:26"><subtitle>
That's great. But also...Maybe something involving a submarine?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:33"><subtitle>
You keep thinking.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:34"><subtitle>
Hey, are we about to shoot something?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:36"><subtitle>
I'm meeting a friend for lunch.You don't know her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:38"><subtitle>
It's gonna be a while still.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:39"><subtitle>
Flippy is working through his "process."And I am helping.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:43"><subtitle>
Sounds good. Just remember,you are not responsiblefor the dysfunction of others.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:47"><subtitle>
What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:48"><subtitle>
I'm just saying don't let himget you down.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:50"><subtitle>
Where did you hear that?About the dysfunction of others?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:52"><subtitle>
I don't know. Just around.It's a thing people say.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:55"><subtitle>
<description>Diana</description> Mm...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:56"><subtitle>
Hey, are we gonna get new pages todayor what?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:58"><subtitle>
W-w-wait, did you say "Princess Carolyn"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:00"><subtitle>
I'm sorry, "Priscilla Crustacean."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:04"><subtitle>
Vamanos, on the pages, okay?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:05"><subtitle>
I've been here all day today,Wednesday, October 24th,waiting for something to shoot.Andele, andele, andele!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:12"><subtitle>
I think your Priscilla Crustaceanis the same personas my Tangled Fog of Pulsating Yearningin the shape of a woman!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:19"><subtitle>
And if she was on set all dayWednesday, that means--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:22"><subtitle>
Bu-- Hold on,I'm getting to the juicy part.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:25"><subtitle>
As soon as I get the thing,I don't want it anymore.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:28"><subtitle>
It feels cheap.So, no, I wouldn't like a bottle of water.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:31"><subtitle>
-<description>Diana grunts</description>-Emotionally naked!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:33"><subtitle>
-I knew it!-Diana! Let me explain.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:34"><subtitle>
How long has he been your client?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:37"><subtitle>
-Not a client.-Three--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:38"><subtitle>
Days. Friends for three days.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:40"><subtitle>
I asked you not to see her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:42"><subtitle>
I asked for one part of my lifethat I could have to myself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:45"><subtitle>
News flash, you're not the only onegoing through shit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:47"><subtitle>
Maybe if I could talk to you,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:49"><subtitle>
I wouldn't need to be lookingfor other friends.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:51"><subtitle>
Diana, is there anything you'd liketo discuss with BoBo?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:54"><subtitle>
We can do it right here.This is a safe space.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:56"><subtitle>
No. This doesn't feellike a safe space anymore.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:59"><subtitle>
I can't keep coming hereif I know you're also seeing him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:03"><subtitle>
Then it sounds likeour time together is done.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:07"><subtitle>
What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:07"><subtitle>
You're setting a boundary.It is good.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:09"><subtitle>
Go forth with the tools I've given you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:11"><subtitle>
Live your life, Diana.Like a candle in the wind.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:14"><subtitle>
-I can't believe this is happening.-I think BoBo needs me more.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:17"><subtitle>
-Would you like validation?-No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:19"><subtitle>
Your validation is worthless to me now.You two deserve each other.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:22"><subtitle>
<description>grunts</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:24"><subtitle>
Oh, you meant parking validation.I actually would like that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:27"><subtitle>
Wow, I can't believe you chose BoBoover your client of seven years.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:31"><subtitle>
At a certain point,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:32"><subtitle>
I can't hold myself responsiblefor other people's dysfunction.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:35"><subtitle>
I mean, that is kind of your job.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:38"><subtitle>
But at least now you can helpthe Angsty Zebra, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:40"><subtitle>
Well...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:42"><subtitle>
-Okay. Now for the real work to begin.-Real what now?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:45"><subtitle>
You did the hard part,admitting you need help.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:47"><subtitle>
Did I admit that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:48"><subtitle>
And now comes the even harder part,getting the help.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:51"><subtitle>
-Let's talk about your mother.-You know what? This has been great.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:54"><subtitle>
I got what I wantedand I made so much progress!</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:58"><subtitle>
-Yes. You did it!-I--</subtitle>

You changed my stripes!Dr. Indira, you're great at your job!</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:04"><subtitle>
I can't believe I lost two clientsin one day.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:07"><subtitle>
You're focusing on the negative.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:09"><subtitle>
I'm sure you helped themin ways you'll never know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:15"><subtitle>
This area's all mine.This is fair game. Ya see the line?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:19"><subtitle>
What about popcorn?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:20"><subtitle>
Popped is mine. Unpopped is fair game.</subtitle>

-Hello?-<description>Mary-Beth</description> Todd.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:26"><subtitle>
Princess Carolyn was on set all day,the day of the string cheese theft.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:29"><subtitle>
She was not homewhen the cheese went missing,rendering any arbitration agreement madeunder those conditions null and void.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:36"><subtitle>
Whoa! Thanks a lot, Mary-Beth.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:39"><subtitle>
Just doing my job, kid.A doctor heals. A DJ spins.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:42"><subtitle>
Bryce Dallas Howard takes the gigs,Jessica Chastain says no to.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:46"><subtitle>
And Mary-Beth mediates.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:49"><subtitle>
So, it sounds likeyou didn't take my string cheese.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:52"><subtitle>
That's what I've been saying!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:53"><subtitle>
I don't even know why we had to go throughcorporate mediation in the first place!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:56"><subtitle>
I guess I just wanted it to bea workplace dispute,because I thought if you knewit was a roommate dispute,you might kick me out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:03"><subtitle>
I'm not gonna kick you out.I like having you around.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:06"><subtitle>
Oh, really?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:07"><subtitle>
Who else would I get to keep my keys cold?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:09"><subtitle>
You know, I have this job now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:12"><subtitle>
Maybe I could start paying,I believe it's pronounced "roaunnt?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:17"><subtitle>
Rent? Well. That's a great idea.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:19"><subtitle>
But I also need my own space.Which is why I wanted that office.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:23"><subtitle>
Well, then, let's get you that office.I just need to grab my pen.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:29"><subtitle>
-Hey!-Ugh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:32"><subtitle>
Hey. I want to apologize...for my behavior at Dr. Indira's.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:39"><subtitle>
-Don't worry about it.-She was right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:40"><subtitle>
You need her more than I do.And I think she can really help you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:44"><subtitle>
Help with what?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:45"><subtitle>
I was looking for someoneto hang out with during my lunch.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:47"><subtitle>
I didn't want somepsycho-babbling quack jobtelling me to get in touchwith my feelings.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:52"><subtitle>
-Who needs that?-I do. I need that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:54"><subtitle>
You don't anymore!She said it herself, you're fixed!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:57"><subtitle>
And then after you left, I was like,</subtitle>
