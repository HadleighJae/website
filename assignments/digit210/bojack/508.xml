<timestamp time="00:04:26"><subtitle>
Remember when I invited youto my Halloween party, and you said,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:29"><subtitle>
you'd love to come, but couldn't</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:31"><subtitle>
because you were havingyour own Halloween party?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:33"><subtitle>
Oh, right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:33"><subtitle>
Well, I'm sure my guests will show upany minute, so, you should probably go.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:37"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:54"><subtitle>
God damn it, why are you here?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:56"><subtitle>
At the end of last year's Halloween party,you said, "Let's do this again next year,"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:00"><subtitle>
like you've said at every Halloween partyfor the last 11 years!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:03"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:21"><subtitle>
So, we're having a party?Why didn't you say this was happening?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:23"><subtitle>
Because I hate that it happens.I take no action to make it happen.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:26"><subtitle>
Every year, I pray that it won't happen,and it keeps happening anyway!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:29"><subtitle>
I feel like an idiot beingat a Halloween party without a costume.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:32"><subtitle>
-Who cares? I don't have a costume.-Uh, you're wearing a costume.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:35"><subtitle>
Do you mean, in the sensethat we all wear costumes,such as we reveal facets of ourselvesto those closest to us,but our truest selves remain hidden?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:42"><subtitle>
No, in the sensethat you are literally wearing a costume</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:45"><subtitle>
-from the TV show we both work on.-Oh, yeah!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:47"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:48"><subtitle>
Don't let the party endbefore I get back.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:44"><subtitle>
Oh, no! Why did I give you the optionof trick or treat? I just wanted treat!</subtitle>

-It's not mine. It's my boyfriend's.-Really?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:02"><subtitle>
-Why does he make you answer the door?-No, he doesn't make me, he's--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:06"><subtitle>
Oh, my God. You're right! What am I doing?What am I doing with my life?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:10"><subtitle>
Uh, well, judging by your outfit,I'd say you're a pilot of some sort?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:13"><subtitle>
I moved to L.A. when I was 18and now I'm 35!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:16"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:07:20"><subtitle>
Am I going to be 35 soon?That's when they make you president!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:23"><subtitle>
I don't want that!That's too much responsibility!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:26"><subtitle>
I can't do this anymore.You! Take my shift!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:29"><subtitle>
Oh, no!The responsibilities are already starting!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:32"><subtitle>
I gotta live my life!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:33"><subtitle>
I deserve to be adored by a man,yet here my dreams lie dormant!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:36"><subtitle>
I don't mean to get mordantly morbid,but did I get all adorably adornedto get bored manning doors? No more!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:43"><subtitle>
Okay, this cider has not beensufficiently alcoholed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:46"><subtitle>
If I'm trapped here with all you losers,I'm at least getting drunk.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:50"><subtitle>
<description>sips</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:51"><subtitle>
Whoa! God! I thinksomebody spiked the cider!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:53"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description> Well, I guessone drink won't hurt.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:57"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:14"><subtitle>
No, no, please don't go talk to Erica.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:16"><subtitle>
Katrina. Erica doesn't know anybody elseat this party.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:19"><subtitle>
It would be rude to leave herall by herself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:21"><subtitle>
Well, can I at least come with you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:23"><subtitle>
You know Erica can't talkto two people at onceon account of her split-brain procedure!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:27"><subtitle>
Why don't you go talk to, uh...the teacher from Ferris Bueller's Day Off?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:30"><subtitle>
Ben Stein?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:31"><subtitle>
I'll bet that famously boring manis a blast at parties. I'll be right back.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:35"><subtitle>
-No, don't---Erica! Love the costume!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:38"><subtitle>
Where did you find such a hideous--?Oh, my mistake, I'm so sorry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:41"><subtitle>
Ugh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:45"><subtitle>
Are you sure this is a good idea,13-year-old Todd?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:47"><subtitle>
It's part of the Halloween Code.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:50"><subtitle>
If you don't give teenagers candy,they're going to TP your house.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:53"><subtitle>
Okay.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:09:00"><subtitle>
Okay, I've scoped out the party,and I've yet to see a single mummy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:06"><subtitle>
<description>imitating child</description>"Is Mummy coming to see us?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:07"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:11"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:17"><subtitle>
-The one with Brendan Fraser?-Ooh!</subtitle>

And I thought everything was going well,and then somethingreally traumatic happened.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:23"><subtitle>
-Oh, my God, what?-I, uh... I didn't get the part.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:29"><subtitle>
That's it? You just didn't get it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:31"><subtitle>

It's my one major career disappointmentas of 2004,so could you please do methis one thingand make sure I don't see any mummies?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:40"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:12:05"><subtitle>
I'm not jealous of you either,even though you are really intimidating.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:40"><subtitle>
Oh, we're talking about your exes again!That's great.</subtitle>

That's why I started seeing herafter Katrinabecause Katrina was so mean and cynical,and Jessica was sweet and full of life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:52"><subtitle>
Yeah, she sounds awesome.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:54"><subtitle>
