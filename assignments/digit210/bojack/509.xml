</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:56"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:28"><subtitle>
Not Doug! Forgot there was a new one!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:31"><subtitle>
I am so donewith these sexy noble hero hunks.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:35"><subtitle>
The sex is great,but the emotional connectionjust is not there.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:39"><subtitle>
It was the same with me and Yolanda.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:40"><subtitle>
No emotional connection,but the no-sex was amazing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:44"><subtitle>
None of the best sex I ever had.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:46"><subtitle>
You know,I was actually thinking about that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:49"><subtitle>
Remember that idea you hadabout the dating app for asexuals?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:53"><subtitle>
-Nope!-<description>phone clicking</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:54"><subtitle>
Yeah, here we go. <music> Ta-da-da-da! </music></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:56"><subtitle>
<description>Todd</description> "All About That Ace"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:58"><subtitle>
You should get yourself out there.You were the best boyfriend I ever had.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:02"><subtitle>
If only there was a version of youI could have sex with, I'd be all set.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:05"><subtitle>
-Whoa, Emily. I just got a crazy idea.-What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:10"><subtitle>
A restaurant where the menusare printed on garlic bread,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:14"><subtitle>
so after you order,the first course is the menu!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:18"><subtitle>
Oh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:19"><subtitle>
<description>clock ticking</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:24"><subtitle>
So, ever since Philbert wrappedearlier today,the question on everybody's mind is,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:28"><subtitle>
"What's Mr. Peanutbuttergoing to do next?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:31"><subtitle>
You're a serious actor now,so I guess, narrate a documentaryabout global warming,and then take a private jetto the premiere?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:38"><subtitle>
I've been looking for new projects.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:40"><subtitle>
Seems like everything's basedon books these days,so I went to the book storeto scout some material.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:45"><subtitle>
-Mm-hmm.-But all the books are so long now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:48"><subtitle>
-Yeah?-Who has the time?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:49"><subtitle>
I'll just wait 'til the movie comes out,then see the movie,and decide if the book the movieis based on would make a good movie.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:55"><subtitle>
Oh, that's a good strategy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:56"><subtitle>
Anyway, I was heading to the doorin book-length-related frustration...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:00"><subtitle>
<description>groans</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:01"><subtitle>
...when I sawone of those circular greeting card racks.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:03"><subtitle>
Spotted a card that looked interesting,and it's a super-quick read.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:07"><subtitle>

Hmm? Mmm... it's... "Birthday Dad."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:23"><subtitle>
Oh. Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:24"><subtitle>
-You think we can get the film rights?-I'll look into it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:28"><subtitle>
<description>moans</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:31"><subtitle>
<description>giggles</description> So, then Joby was like,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:33"><subtitle>
"Uh, nice scrunchie, Professor."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:36"><subtitle>
It was literally a thing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:38"><subtitle>
Joby is the guy in your dormwho plays guitar?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:39"><subtitle>
Yeah, he's really funny,but like soulful funny, you know?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:43"><subtitle>
-That's great.-Oh...!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:49"><subtitle>
<description>BoJack</description> You know, I always thoughtI would make a good college person.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:19"><subtitle>

</timestamp>

BoJack, have you been takingoxypraxylcortizoid?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:21"><subtitle>
Yeah. I know what you're thinking,but I legitimately have a herniated disc.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:24"><subtitle>
He's telling the truth!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:25"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:29"><subtitle>
-You got drugged by your own mother?-No, my mother.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:31"><subtitle>
Her mother was a maidwho got knocked up by my dad,but she got adopted by eight other dads.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:36"><subtitle>
Okay, do you know how many timesI hear this story every week?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:39"><subtitle>
This story, specifically?Even the "eight dads" part?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:42"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:51"><subtitle>
What's with all the candles?Why are you wearing a robe?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:55"><subtitle>
Oh, I blew a fuse earlier,so I had to light candles.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:58"><subtitle>
That took a while,and then I didn't get to change.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:00"><subtitle>
-Oh.-Hold that thought.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:02"><subtitle>
-The thought of "Oh"?-That's right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:04"><subtitle>
Because you're gonna need itwhen you meet your new best friend...</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:18"><subtitle>
-Stop me if you've heard this one. What?-And guess what?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:22"><subtitle>
I even recorded dozensof sexy robot phrases</subtitle>

<description>robot</description> My prime directiveis to pleasure you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:36"><subtitle>
Todd, I'm not sure you understandhow sex works.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:39"><subtitle>
That is so condescending.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:42"><subtitle>
I know what sex is. I am not a child.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:45"><subtitle>
I'm just not great at building robots.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:47"><subtitle>
This is my first one, and frankly,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:50"><subtitle>
I think it's pretty impressiveI put it together in one afternoon.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:05"><subtitle>
We're spending time together,that's all that matters.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:07"><subtitle>
You're not super-mad at me, still?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:09"><subtitle>
When this is done,maybe it'll make a great storyyou can tell that kid you have a crush on.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:13"><subtitle>
Who, Joby? <description>chuckles</description>I don't have a crush on him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:19"><subtitle>
-Oh, okay.-Where are we going now?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:21"><subtitle>
There's this actress I was kind of seeingwhile we were working togetherand I might have left some pillsat her place.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:27"><subtitle>
She made it clear she doesn't wantto see me again but she's not home now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:30"><subtitle>
-Why do I know Gina's schedule?-Where is she?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:32"><subtitle>
She has a book club with dumb Nicolewho keeps picking very long Italian booksthat Nicole doesn't even read.Why do I know about Gina's friends?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:39"><subtitle>
-Do you have a key?-I have my ways.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:44"><subtitle>
-Well, I'm out of ways.-I'll go around backand see if there's a windowI can climb through.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:48"><subtitle>
Ooh, good thinking! I'll stand guard.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:50"><subtitle>
<description>winces</description> Ugh.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:55"><subtitle>
Oh, my God! What happened to book club?</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:59"><subtitle>
-Why are you here?-I just wanted to check on you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:09"><subtitle>
I just-- I need to talk to you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:11"><subtitle>
Slowly.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:12"><subtitle>
Is this about our relationship?What is there to talk about?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:15"><subtitle>
Well, I just been thinking that...we should keep lookingat this relationship.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:20"><subtitle>
Like all parts of this relationship.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:23"><subtitle>
Like even in the junk drawer,in the kitchen of this relationship.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:26"><subtitle>
-Or the bathroom cabinet.-I told you I didn't want to see you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:30"><subtitle>
I want you to knowthat you are top-shelf, Gina.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:33"><subtitle>
-Know what I mean? Top shelf.-So, what, you wanna get back together?</subtitle>
</timestamp>

-Eh...?-Yes!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:38"><subtitle>
Wait, really?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:39"><subtitle>
-Okay, I gotta run.-BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:40"><subtitle>
I have had 28 on-set flings,and no guy has ever come to my houseafter shooting was over to tryto have a real relationship.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:47"><subtitle>
-Well...-I guess I sort of internalized the idea</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:49"><subtitle>
I didn't deserve that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:50"><subtitle>
Yeah, but like I said, I really gotta run.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:52"><subtitle>
But maybe I do deserve it.Maybe we both do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:55"><subtitle>
BoJack, is it possible that we're the oneswe've been waiting for?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:58"><subtitle>
Uh, yes. I totally think that is possible,which is why I can't waitto talk about this tomorrow!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:03"><subtitle>
-What? Where are you going?-I'll call you!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:05"><subtitle>
<description>Hollyhock panting</description> Whoa!</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:10"><subtitle>
-where I can kinda ghost?-What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:12"><subtitle>
Kidding! I'll call her.I'm very fond of that woman.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:16:15"><subtitle>
And I'm surethat things are gonna work out fine,and we can find a way to be happy togetherand I won't hurt herin a way that she carries with herfor the rest of her life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:22"><subtitle>
-Uh, okay.-Lemme get them pills.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:25"><subtitle>
-What the hell? These aren't my pills!-Sorry!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:27"><subtitle>
-Not your fault. It's just... my back.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:31"><subtitle>
-I got another idea.-Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:33"><subtitle>
-Do you think Gina needed those?-She'll be fine. Nobody needs pills.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:40"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:43"><subtitle>
-Hope that's okay.-It's actually nice you're here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:45"><subtitle>
All the times I imagined ustaking home a baby from the hospital,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:48"><subtitle>
I never pictured it like this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:50"><subtitle>
You mean, you never picturedit would happen on a Friday?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:52"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:16:56"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description> How come you never called meafter I kicked you out of my apartment?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:00"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:02"><subtitle>
I didn't.But you still should have called.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:05"><subtitle>

-I wish you'd stayed with me that night.-You told me to leave.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:11"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:14"><subtitle>
<description>Ralph chuckles</description> Mm-hmm.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:16"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:19"><subtitle>
-Yes?-Oof! Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:25"><subtitle>
I'm supposed to be backat the airport in, like, two hours.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:29"><subtitle>
Is this reallyhow you want to spend this time?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:31"><subtitle>
Again, and... <description>chuckles</description>I hate to keep harping on this,we wouldn't be hereif someone hadn't dumped my medicine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:36"><subtitle>
I know, but this place is super sketchy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:39"><subtitle>
It looks likewhere they did the drag race in Grease.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:42"><subtitle>

Normally, people return the costume.</subtitle>

Hello, drug merchant.Is it lit under here?</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:15"><subtitle>
-Yeah, no, he's definitely a cop.-Seems cool to me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:18"><subtitle>
Listen. If I were a cop,</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:24"><subtitle>
-But I do not. So clearly, not a cop.-Uh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>

<timestamp time="00:19:03"><subtitle>
I'm here because I respect the artof putting out fires. <description>puffs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:06"><subtitle>
- I'm really sorry, Emily.-It was a sweet idea.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:09"><subtitle>
I guess I just thoughtyou waste so much timewith these boring firemenjust for the sex.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:14"><subtitle>
-Eh?-Doug, some privacy, please?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:16"><subtitle>
Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:17"><subtitle>
Maybe I figured if you had some other wayto satisfy yourself sexually,then you could spend more time with me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:23"><subtitle>
-Like we did in high school.-Todd, we were dating in high school.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:27"><subtitle>
Do you ever think aboutwhat it would be like if we dated now?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:31"><subtitle>
I don't know. What would it be like?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:33"><subtitle>
I guess we'd hang out together,like we already do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:35"><subtitle>
And you would be my favorite person,like you already are.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:38"><subtitle>
And when something good happened to me,like if I got a promotion at work,you'd be the first person I'd tell,and you'd smile and say,"That's my boyfriend."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:48"><subtitle>
Well, that could be cool.But then I would have sex with the robot?</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:19:57"><subtitle>
You know,when I was putting the app together,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:00"><subtitle>
I learned that some asexualsactually do have sex.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:03"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:07"><subtitle>
-Okay. Well, you got any other ideas?-Hmm.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:13"><subtitle>
What about if marbles were cube-shaped,so they don't roll away as much?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:18"><subtitle>
