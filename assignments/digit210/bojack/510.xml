<timestamp time="00:02:58"><subtitle>
"Surprising depth"?God, they always gotta slant it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:01"><subtitle>
Why can't it just be "depth"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:02"><subtitle>
I'd hate to see you after a bad review.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:04"><subtitle>

It's because you visited mein the hospital every day,and I got used to having you around,and it turns out I like you.</subtitle>

-Hard no.-Hardly no?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:24"><subtitle>
-That sounds like a yes.-Okay, bye.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:06:26"><subtitle>
-<description>phone beeps</description>-Well, anyway-- hello?</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:06:28"><subtitle>
Huh. He must have accidentally hung up,right after he accidentally said,"Okay, bye."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:36"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:39"><subtitle>
"Shell we dance?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:41"><subtitle>
There are some superficial similarities.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:48"><subtitle>
-Doesn't mean I stole it!-Flip.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:49"><subtitle>
I spent months on that line.I slaved, finessed, crafted.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:54"><subtitle>
The world was a block of marble,and, like Michelangelo,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:57"><subtitle>
I chiseled it into my David,as I did for each and every oneof Crazy AZ's Frozen Funnies.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:05"><subtitle>
Mr. Ziegler, we have so much respectfor your work.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:07"><subtitle>
Do you think I'm like a pennyon a railroad track?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:10"><subtitle>
Prone to flattery?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:12"><subtitle>
We've got a premiere to get to.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:13"><subtitle>
How long do we have to listen to this guydo his Popsicle schtick?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:16"><subtitle>
It's pronounced "stick," idiot.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:18"><subtitle>
Play nice, Flip.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:19"><subtitle>
If this gets out, everyone will be talkingabout the stolen gag,instead of all the great parts of the showthat weren't stolen.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:25"><subtitle>
Fine. What do you want?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:26"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:33"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:37"><subtitle>
I accept your terms. Where do I sign?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:40"><subtitle>
-Can we go now?-Wait.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:42"><subtitle>
"Abel Ziegler ampersand"?What are you ampersanding?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:45"><subtitle>
-My former writing partner, Ziggy Abler.-What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:48"><subtitle>
I can only give permissionfor the part I wrote.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:50"><subtitle>
I'm the set-up guy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:52"><subtitle>
If you want the punch line,you gotta talk to Ziggy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:54"><subtitle>
Can you ask him to sign the release?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:56"><subtitle>
I can't even ask him the best timeto go to the dentist.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:59"><subtitle>
He hasn't talked to me for 30 years.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:01"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:08"><subtitle>
A real Hollywoo premiere party.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:10"><subtitle>
Can we get our pictures taken,and drink specialty cocktails,and form life-long bondswith other fancy celebrities,and read in magazines,"Who wore it better?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:17"><subtitle>
And then people vote,and then 78 percent of readers say,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:20"><subtitle>
-"Pickles did!"-<description>chuckles</description></subtitle>

Hey, BoJack, can we get some of just you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:30"><subtitle>
-Oh, uh, yeah.-Mm-hmm. I'll see you in there.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:32"><subtitle>
FYI, you're gonna want pictures of herafter you see what she does in Philbert.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:36"><subtitle>
Let me tell you something,that 39-year-old actress is going places.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:40"><subtitle>
-Oh. Hey.-What happened to your arm?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:42"><subtitle>
-Oh, just some asshole got T-boned by me.-Oh, my God. When?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:47"><subtitle>
Uh... couple weeks ago? Or months?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:52"><subtitle>
As Philbert says, "Time is like a woman;completely impossible to comprehend."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:57"><subtitle>
I think we ended up cutting that linebecause the network was worriedit would be offensiveto people who didn't knowwhat time it was.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:09:04"><subtitle>
-<description>clattering</description>-This you call a tip?</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:09:08"><subtitle>
You must be Ziggy Abler.Oh, thank you so much for coming.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:12"><subtitle>
Darling, you're wasting your time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:14"><subtitle>
I love to sign documents.In fact, that's my signature move.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:17"><subtitle>
But if Abel signed it, I won't.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:19"><subtitle>
I guess you could say I'm willing,but not Abel!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:22"><subtitle>
-Oh...!-Now where are those tiny tacos?</subtitle>

Oh, is it five o'clock already?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:39"><subtitle>
If you've poured me a drink,you must want something.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:41"><subtitle>
-Out with it.-<description>Henry</description> I want to be on top of you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:44"><subtitle>
There's no one on top of me.I'm CEO of this company.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:47"><subtitle>
-That's my favorite position.-Well, you can't have it. It's mine.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:03"><subtitle>
For my job, yes, you've been quite clear.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:06"><subtitle>
But if you were CEO, what would I do?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:09"><subtitle>
Take a portraiture classat the Learning Annex?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:11"><subtitle>
While away the hours,painting canvas after canvas of my wife,and, through this act,rediscover the woman I fell in love withthose many years ago?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:21"><subtitle>
No, such a realization would only crushmy too-feeble heart.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:24"><subtitle>
After all, what benefit is it to lovewithout the words to express it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:28"><subtitle>
What could I possibly say to articulatemy deep devotion to this woman,who has become but a stranger to me now?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:35"><subtitle>
<description>whirring</description> I am powerless in the faceof your mesmerizing sexual energy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:46"><subtitle>
So, I am resigning from my post,effective immediately.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:24"><subtitle>
Thank you for attending the premiereof my opus.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:26"><subtitle>
I hope you all enjoy itbecause that means you are smart.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:29"><subtitle>
If you don't get it, that meansthat my genius wasn't appreciatedin my own time, and that's okay, too.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:34"><subtitle>
<description>weak laughter</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:36"><subtitle>
Why are you laughing?Please do not laugh during the screening.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:39"><subtitle>
This episode containsno intentional humor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:41"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description> Okay. That's--that's always a good sign,when you have to clarify that.Look, folks, Herb is being modest.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:47"><subtitle>
-"Herb"?-I'm sorry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:49"><subtitle>
<description>laughs</description> Flip. Did I say Herb?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:52"><subtitle>
Herb is being modest,but he put together a tremendous showthat I think that you guysare really gonna love.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:58"><subtitle>
That's right.It all came out of this brain.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:01"><subtitle>
-Ha! That brain, he says?-That brain? Double-ha!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:05"><subtitle>
Shh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:06"><subtitle>
And the most amazing thing about this showis that I'm sure we all have Philbertsin our lives,or we are Philberts.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:13"><subtitle>
You know, we've all done terrible thingsthat we deeply regret.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:16"><subtitle>
I've done so many... unforgivable things.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:19"><subtitle>
And I think that,that's what this show says.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:22"><subtitle>
Is that... is that we're all terrible,so therefore we're all... okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:27"><subtitle>
What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:27"><subtitle>
And I thinkthat's a really powerful message.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:31"><subtitle>
Okay, well, without further ado,the first chapter,and notice I said "chapter" not episodebecause I think of this show as moreof a novel than a TV show...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:40"><subtitle>
-of Philbert!-<description>applause</description></subtitle>

Hey, Pickles, where have you been?You left after, like, ten minutes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:01"><subtitle>
I'm sorry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:03"><subtitle>
My friend Ilana, not my best friend Ilana,but another Ilana who is my friend,was having a crisis,and I needed to text her "LOL."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:09"><subtitle>
Well, you missed the whole episode.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:11"><subtitle>
I saw the first ten minutes!I just couldn't get into it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:14"><subtitle>
And you kept saying,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:15"><subtitle>
"Do you love it? Are you loving it?How did you like that scene?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:18"><subtitle>
Well, did you love it? Were you loving it?How did you like that scene?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:21"><subtitle>
Every time you showed up on screen,I kept thinking,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:23"><subtitle>
"That's not a dirty cop,that's my boyfriend!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:26"><subtitle>
The sweetest, cutest dogin the whole world!"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:29"><subtitle>
And then you'd shoot someone,and I was like... eww!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:31"><subtitle>
-Fritz is the hardest I've ever acted.-Oh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:34"><subtitle>
Harder than the ice bucket challenge,but it was fake ice.I wanted you to see it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:38"><subtitle>
I'm going to fix this.You stay here and party.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:40"><subtitle>
I'll go home.I'll watch the entire season of your show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:43"><subtitle>
You don't have to do that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:44"><subtitle>
And you don't have to like every oneof my Instagram posts, but you do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:49"><subtitle>
The least I could dois watch your TV show,even if it kills mebecause I hate it so much.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:55"><subtitle>
-Well, don't watch it if you hate it.-I'm going to do this for us.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:58"><subtitle>
-But---I love you!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:00"><subtitle>
-<description>sighs</description>-<description>buzzing</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:03"><subtitle>
I've been to dozens of these thingsand I've never heard applause like that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:06"><subtitle>
We might actually get a season two.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:07"><subtitle>
-That's never happened to me before.-That's incredible.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:10"><subtitle>
Excuse me,can I borrow you for a few minutes?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:13"><subtitle>
-Oh, sure. Gina, do you mind if I, um...?-Yeah, go ahead.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:15"><subtitle>
Oh, no, I was actually talking to Gina.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:18"><subtitle>
Me? I'm being borrowed for a few minutes?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:20"><subtitle>
Oh! Well, yeah. Yeah, of course.Yeah, yeah. Sure.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:23"><subtitle>
Wow. Oh, my God.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:25"><subtitle>
Hey, how you doing? Hey, you came!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:27"><subtitle>
Flip, I screwed up.I didn't know it would feel like that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:30"><subtitle>
To be in that room.To hear people cheering for Philbert!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:33"><subtitle>
-What are you talking about?-When I first started on this job,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:36"><subtitle>
I wanted to make Philbertmore well-rounded,so the audiencecould relate to him better.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:40"><subtitle>
And now you're upsetbecause I didn't mention youin my introduction.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:44"><subtitle>
Diane, the whole point of televisionis it's a collaborative medium,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:48"><subtitle>
-where one person gets all the credit.-No, it's not about that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:52"><subtitle>
I made him more vulnerable,and that made him more likable,which makes for a better TV show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:57"><subtitle>
But if Philbert is just a wayto help dumb assholes rationalizetheir own awful behavior,well, I'm sorry,but we can't put this out there.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:04"><subtitle>
Uh, it's out there.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:05"><subtitle>
The whole season's dropping at midnightall over the world.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:08"><subtitle>
-I can't be here.-<description>Flip sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:10"><subtitle>
Come on, fellas.I know we can find a solution here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:13"><subtitle>
I doubt it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:14"><subtitle>
We have the same problemas a hematology labthat goes a week without electricity!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:19"><subtitle>
Too much bad blood!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:21"><subtitle>
But you obviously work together so well.What went wrong?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:24"><subtitle>
It was a long time ago.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:26"><subtitle>
My wife Harrietalways had a sneaker for Ziggy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:29"><subtitle>
Oh, and the unspoken resentment crept in?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:31"><subtitle>
Unspoken? It was shouted!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:33"><subtitle>
Nevertheless, me and Harriet ended uphaving a fling.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:36"><subtitle>
Eventually, we got married.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:38"><subtitle>
-And that killed the partnership?-No, we got over that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:40"><subtitle>
But at their tenth anniversary,I had a few too many--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:43"><subtitle>
And what, you took a swing at him?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:45"><subtitle>
I said I always felthe had the easier job,coming up with the punch lines.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:49"><subtitle>
And then what? What led to the rift?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:51"><subtitle>
Led? That's the whole rift!He besmirched my craft.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:55"><subtitle>
I still haven't forgiventhe son of a bitch!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:57"><subtitle>
I said it then, and I stand by it now!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:01"><subtitle>
All the pressure's on the punch line!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:04"><subtitle>
Pressure? Please!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:05"><subtitle>
Set-ups need context,mise-en-scène, flavor!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:09"><subtitle>
I carried us to the topof the Popsicle stick game!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:13"><subtitle>
You wrote the partthey let you try before you buy!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:15"><subtitle>
I had to deliver the money line!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:17"><subtitle>
<description>both</description> Ugh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:18"><subtitle>
So, you both think you had the harder job?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:21"><subtitle>
-<description>Abel</description> Of course!-Indubitably!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:22"><subtitle>
Well, what if you tried switching roles?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:24"><subtitle>
-You mean, I tag his set-ups?-Why not?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:27"><subtitle>
I don't know.I'm a punch line guy my whole life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:30"><subtitle>
How do I come up with straight lines?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:33"><subtitle>
-You could try using a ruler.-Oh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:36"><subtitle>
<description>both laugh</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:38"><subtitle>
-Oh, I missed you, Abel!-You, too, Zig!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:42"><subtitle>
All right, so we have a deal?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:43"><subtitle>
What did the terminally ill man sayto Dr. Kevorkian?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:47"><subtitle>
"Give me that sweet release!"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:53"><subtitle>
Hey.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:54"><subtitle>
Did you really mean what you said,before the screening?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:57"><subtitle>
About how Philbert made you feel okay,about yourself?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:00"><subtitle>
Oh, I don't know--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:01"><subtitle>
Because, you know,that's not the point of Philbert--for guys to watch it and feel okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:06"><subtitle>
Diane, it's a compliment.You did a good job. Relax.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:08"><subtitle>
I don't want you, or anyone else,justifying their shitty behaviorbecause of the show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:12"><subtitle>
What is your problem?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:13"><subtitle>
Why can't you acceptthat something you did is successful?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:16"><subtitle>
It's connecting to people,and that's good.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:18"><subtitle>
You're right, sorry.I don't know why I thought you would care.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:20"><subtitle>
-Excuse me?-What is going on with you? You're a mess.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:23"><subtitle>
-Am I?-I feel like I barely know you anymore.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:27"><subtitle>
Oh, bullshit. Don't give me that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:28"><subtitle>
-It's true. I don't know you.-No. You know me. You do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:31"><subtitle>
Then what the hell happened in New Mexico?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:34"><subtitle>
Look, I...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:35"><subtitle>
I don't know what you thinkthat you know--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:37"><subtitle>
I don't know anything!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:38"><subtitle>
I mean, I know something happenedwith a girl in New Mexico,and I know it resulted inyou coming home in a boat.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:44"><subtitle>
-Well, that's---I also know...that your old friend Charlottelives in New Mexicobecause you used to leaveher business card lying around the house,and I know her daughter is a seniorat Oberlin.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:52"><subtitle>
-How--?-And I know you went to Oberlinduring your bender three years agobecause a bunch of studentsposted pictures of you on Facebook.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:58"><subtitle>
Jesus Christ,why are you so obsessed with me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:01"><subtitle>
I am not obsessed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:02"><subtitle>
I wanted to know what happened,and you wouldn't tell me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:05"><subtitle>
-You never asked!-Okay, so I'm asking now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:08"><subtitle>
What happened in New Mexico?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:10"><subtitle>
-Hallo! Smile for Yahoo, Finland!-<description>camera shutter clicks</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:13"><subtitle>
What I don't understand is why you feellike you deserve to knowevery shitty thing I ever did.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:18"><subtitle>
I don't deserve anything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:19"><subtitle>
I would like to knowwhen you've done shitty things.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:22"><subtitle>
Why is that your business?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:23"><subtitle>
Because I'm your friend,and I care about you,and I wrote a book about you,and now I wrote this show for you,and I am very publicly your friend,so if it gets out that you're doingcreepy stuff, that makes me look bad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:35"><subtitle>
Oh! So you're worried about thingsthat I may have donebecause you thinkthat it reflects badly on you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:41"><subtitle>
Hurts your brand?That's your moral high ground?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:43"><subtitle>
This is not about "moral high ground."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:45"><subtitle>
Wanna know about New Mexico?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:46"><subtitle>
You want to know about the onelittle thing that I did in New Mexico,which, by the way,wasn't even really a thing?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:51"><subtitle>
-You know what? Spare me.-No, I'm gonna tell you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:53"><subtitle>
I'll tell you what you want.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:54"><subtitle>
And while I'm at it, you wanna hear aboutwhat happened at the MTV beach house?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:57"><subtitle>
Or why I'm not allowedto fly United anymore?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:59"><subtitle>
Or what happened with Sharona,the makeup lady on Horsing Around?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:02"><subtitle>
-What?-Or the dozens of other shady thingsthat may or may not have occurredin my life that I can barely even remember</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:07"><subtitle>
'cause I was high or drunkor it was 30 years ago?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:10"><subtitle>
And you don't feel bad,about any of this stuff?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:12"><subtitle>
Yeah, of course I do!I've spent so much time feeling bad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:15"><subtitle>
By the way, most of these women...don't even remember, I bet.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:19"><subtitle>
Well, that's really convenient for you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:21"><subtitle>
I'm the onewho has to live with this shit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:22"><subtitle>
I'm the one who has to feel the guiltall day, every day.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:25"><subtitle>
So, you're the victim here?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:27"><subtitle>
Yeah, and I knowthat's not the woke, progressive,intersectionally appropriate thing to say,but I would say, yeah!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:33"><subtitle>
I'm the one who has suffered the mostbecause of the actions of BoJack Horseman.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:36"><subtitle>
-You've suffered?-Yeah, I have!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:38"><subtitle>
-The most?-The most!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:39"><subtitle>
Really? More than, say, Sarah Lynn?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:43"><subtitle>
Don't talk to me about her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:45"><subtitle>
No, I wanna know how you're the victimof the Sarah Lynn story.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:49"><subtitle>
-I'm serious.-Explain to me...how Sarah Lynn's overdose wasreally rough for you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:53"><subtitle>
-Shut up.-You feel a lot of guilt about that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:55"><subtitle>
You feel a lot of guilt because you werethe only father figure she ever had,and when she came to you for help, you--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:00"><subtitle>
-Hey, how you doing?-You folks having a good time?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:03"><subtitle>
You look great. Thanks for coming.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:04"><subtitle>
-You had sex with her?-That's-- ! No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:06"><subtitle>
And then when she was sober,you took her on a month-long bender?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:10"><subtitle>
And then she died. And she is dead now.And you're still alive.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:14"><subtitle>
With a girlfriend, who is also alive,and a TV show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:17"><subtitle>
And that's been really hard for you,the main character in this story.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:21"><subtitle>
Why are you bringing this shit up?Is this fun for you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:24"><subtitle>
-To really rub in---It's not fun.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:26"><subtitle>
You win! You scored all the pointsin the argument!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:28"><subtitle>
According to facts, you are rightand I am wrong, like always.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:32"><subtitle>
But you know what? I don't care.Because I'm trying to move forward.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:35"><subtitle>
You haven't changed at all.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:36"><subtitle>
Yes! Congratulations!You are the last person to get that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:39"><subtitle>
I'm not gonna change.I don't need your help for changing,so you can stop tryingto make me your project.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:45"><subtitle>
-That's not---When I met you, I was depressedbecause I didn't like myself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:49"><subtitle>
And when you wrote that bookand sold a bajillion copies,you taught me that as screwed upas I am, that's okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:56"><subtitle>
You did that. And now I'm okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:59"><subtitle>
I don't believe that's true.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:01"><subtitle>
And I don't think you believe it's true.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:04"><subtitle>
I think you want me to tell youthat you can be better.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:08"><subtitle>
And even though you're beinga total asshole right now,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:12"><subtitle>
I still believe it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:13"><subtitle>
If all you've gottenout of this friendship,is the idea that you should be okaywith yourself, as you are,then I don't thinkthis is a good relationship...for either of us.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:22"><subtitle>
-Diane, come on.-I'm going home.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:24"><subtitle>
No, Diane, we're saying things,but let's just go back to the party.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:28"><subtitle>
I'm done... with all of this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:30"><subtitle>
I went to New Mexico to see Charlotte.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:33"><subtitle>
