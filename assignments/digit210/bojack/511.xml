The air is thickwith the stench of death,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:11"><subtitle>
and the hospitals are deliveringsome very wacky babies.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:14"><subtitle>
But, finally, they reopenedthe Yogurtland near me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:18"><subtitle>
Sometimes, even mushroom cloudshave a silver lining.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:22"><subtitle>
Hey, partner. Looks like you're gettingsoft... serve frozen yogurt.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:25"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:32"><subtitle>
About Fritz. My wife.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:34"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:02:41"><subtitle>
BoJack, I told younot to eat the prop food.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:43"><subtitle>
That fake yogurt costs $500 a cup!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:46"><subtitle>
Why?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:50"><subtitle>
<description>BoJack</description> It's been two months sincethe first season of Philbert came out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:53"><subtitle>
And it's a hit. Which is great for me,but even better for Gina.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:04"><subtitle>
You know, I've done so many TV shows,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:06"><subtitle>
but this is the first onethat's kind of turned me into a star.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:08"><subtitle>
It's a big step up from just recurringon The Cops are Coming,Whee-oo, Whee-oo.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:12"><subtitle>
<description>BoJack</description> And the weird part isI'm not secretly bitter and jealous.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:15"><subtitle>
I like seeing her happy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:18"><subtitle>
But I still have this little rancid itchsaying something isn't right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:22"><subtitle>
It's like there's always somethinglurking just beyond the horizon.</subtitle>

I see. Thank you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:32"><subtitle>
Why do you still use a landline?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:34"><subtitle>
<description>Philbert</description> What am I supposed to tell her,I'm just an old-fashioned guy?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:37"><subtitle>
Or maybe I like thingsthat are plugged to the wall?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:39"><subtitle>
Something to grab ontoif I start floating away.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:42"><subtitle>
That was my wife's landline.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:03:46"><subtitle>
-I'm so sorry.-Never mind that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:48"><subtitle>
The chief's been murdered.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:49"><subtitle>
Oh, Philbert, that's awful.I know you didn't want him to be murdered.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:52"><subtitle>
Sassy, put on some pants.You've got a sweet bottom,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:55"><subtitle>
but the only bottomI'm interested in right now</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:57"><subtitle>
is the bottom of this case,and getting to it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:59"><subtitle>
Because this time, it's personnel.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:04"><subtitle>
-Cut!-<description>bell rings</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:06"><subtitle>
Did you want me to say,"This time it's personal"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:08"><subtitle>
No, that's a clich√©.You're saying it's an inside job.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:11"><subtitle>
Someone on the force."This time, it's personnel."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:14"><subtitle>
-Ah, okay.-The strangling looks fake.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:17"><subtitle>
Ooh, maybe it would be scarier...<description>wailing</description> if I talked like this--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:20"><subtitle>
I already told you. No spooky voice!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:22"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:27"><subtitle>
-Eh...?-Yeah, let's try that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:29"><subtitle>
Gina, you noticed anything funkyabout these new scripts?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:32"><subtitle>
Yeah. Without Diane around to policeFlip's use of the word "literally,"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:35"><subtitle>
you'd think "the literally store"was going out of business. Figuratively.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:38"><subtitle>
What? No. I mean the story with the chief.I think it's stolen from my life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:42"><subtitle>
I mean, I also had a male boss who died.Herb Kazazz.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:46"><subtitle>
Seems like a coincidence.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:47"><subtitle>
The chief is named Basil.Like basil, which is an herb! Like Herb.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:51"><subtitle>
I don't think anyone would use a storyfrom your life without telling you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:54"><subtitle>
-Diane would.-She's not writing on the show anymore.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:57"><subtitle>
You think Flip read her book?Wait a minute. "Her book." "Herb... ook."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:01"><subtitle>
-What's going on with you?-I'm gonna get to the bottom of thisbecause this time, it's business.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:05"><subtitle>
Personal business.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:15"><subtitle>
Do you make them up,or get inspiredby other things or people's... lives?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:20"><subtitle>
What are you accusing me of?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:21"><subtitle>
You think I can't come upwith my own ideas?</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:38"><subtitle>
Something about "popsicle guys."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:40"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:30"><subtitle>
"Ya think?"And sundry retorts of that fashion.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:35"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:29"><subtitle>
Uh, no, nothing came today!I wasn't looking at anything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
