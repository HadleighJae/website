</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:45"><subtitle>
-Hello?-Princess Carolyn! It's Sadie.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:47"><subtitle>
Remember me? You wanted my baby,and you came down to Eden,then you thought about your past a lot,and I decided not to give you my baby?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:53"><subtitle>
Of course I remember you, Sadie.Unfortunately, this isn't a great time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:57"><subtitle>
Anyway, I got to thinking... I intervieweda lot of people for adoption.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:00"><subtitle>
After I saidI wasn't gonna give them the baby,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:02"><subtitle>
They all went cold or nasty. Except you.You were still nice.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:05"><subtitle>
-<description>tires screech</description>-I think that's a sign. <description>grunts</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:07"><subtitle>
-How fast can you get to Eden?-Why?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:09"><subtitle>
My boyfriend left me,my mama stole my truck,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:11"><subtitle>
-and I don't want this baby no more.-Oh, fish, Sadie.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:14"><subtitle>
I'm kind of in the middleof something now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:16"><subtitle>
You're in the middle of something?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:17"><subtitle>
I'm about as deep in contractionsas an apostrophe!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:20"><subtitle>
-<description>panting</description>-I know. This is all just coming so fast.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:23"><subtitle>
I... Let me call you back.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:24"><subtitle>
Okay, but if this baby pops outand you're not here,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:27"><subtitle>
-I'm putting it in a dumpster.-<description>gasps</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:29"><subtitle>
I'm kidding,I'm giving it to someone else. <description>grunts</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:36"><subtitle>
-Hey.-Hi.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:38"><subtitle>
I always forget how tinyand Dickensian this place is.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:41"><subtitle>
It's really great how you don't neednice things to be happy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:45"><subtitle>
-Yes, I agree. What do you want?-<description>door closes</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:47"><subtitle>
For the last couple months,I've had work to distract me,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:49"><subtitle>
but now that we're on strangle hiatus,I can't stop thinking about that "thing"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:54"><subtitle>
that happened in the prepiereof the Philbert.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:55"><subtitle>
-"Strangle hiatus?"-Diane, stay on topic.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:58"><subtitle>
-You know what "thing" I'm talking about?-Yes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:00"><subtitle>
-The thing between us?-Got it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:01"><subtitle>
When we had sex?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:02"><subtitle>
I was on top and then briefly on bottom.Human-y style?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:05"><subtitle>
Yep, I remember.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:06"><subtitle>
Pickles has no idea,and I've never felt so guilty in my life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:09"><subtitle>
I hate keeping secrets from people.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:11"><subtitle>
It's like Rob Schneider'ssurprise party all over again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:13"><subtitle>
You cheating on your girlfriendis not the sameas Rob Schneider's surprise party.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:17"><subtitle>
You're right, this is much less sadand involves more people.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:20"><subtitle>
-Just tell Pickles the truth.-Oh, I'm not good at giving bad news.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:25"><subtitle>
-Could you do it?-What? No!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:27"><subtitle>
But you're so good at bumming people out.I'm more of a "good news" guy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:31"><subtitle>
You want your ex-wife to explain the factthat you cheated with your ex-wifeto your current girlfriend?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:37"><subtitle>
Well, of course every idea sounds stupidif you describe what it is.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:40"><subtitle>
You're not the only onewho feels gross about that night.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:43"><subtitle>
Do you have any idea how shitty I feltafter you left?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:46"><subtitle>
So I made you feel gross, and now...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:48"><subtitle>
No, you didn't make me anything!I am gross.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:51"><subtitle>
I feel, all the time, like a garbage fire.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:54"><subtitle>
And not a cozy dumpster in a quaint alley,but a barge, floating out to sea,with no rudder.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:00"><subtitle>
I am a rudderless burninglarge garbage barge.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:03"><subtitle>
Well, I'm sorry that you feel that wayall the time,but I don't usually,and now, for the first time ever, I do,and I don't know what to dowith that feeling!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:11"><subtitle>
-Good! You should feel bad!-Well, I do!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:14"><subtitle>
-Great! Me, too!-Great!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:16"><subtitle>
Great!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:18"><subtitle>
<description>both moaning, kissing</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:26"><subtitle>
So, what, exactly,do you think happened last night?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:30"><subtitle>
Uh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:31"><subtitle>
I don't know. We shot some stuff?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:34"><subtitle>
There was an accident on setand Gina got injured.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:37"><subtitle>
-Oh, my God, she did?-She's fine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:39"><subtitle>
-But some footage has gotten out.-Footage?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:42"><subtitle>
And because of how it looks,some people might get the impressionthat you were trying to hurt Gina.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:47"><subtitle>
-They're gonna get the impression.-Right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:50"><subtitle>
-But I wasn't.-Of course not.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:52"><subtitle>
What did happen?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:53"><subtitle>
So, the two of you are gonna doa sit-down interview with Biscuits Braxby.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:58"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description> She makes news fun!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:59"><subtitle>
Yes. All you need to say is thatyou know the footage looks bad,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:02"><subtitle>
but you and Gina are actors.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:04"><subtitle>
You performed a convincing scene,and you can't waitfor everyone to see the new season.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:09"><subtitle>
Well, it seems like you've got everythingunder control.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:12"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description> I'm sorry things got so messywith the show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:16"><subtitle>
I didn't always look out for youas much as I should have.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:18"><subtitle>
I can take care of myself.I know you've got a lot on your plate.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:21"><subtitle>
It's just been so crazy,this adoption process,but I think once I get a baby,my life will be less hectic, you know?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:28"><subtitle>
Oh, sure.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:29"><subtitle>
That is why new mothers alwaysseem so chilled-out and well-rested.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:31"><subtitle>
Okay, buddy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:32"><subtitle>
Why don't you save your funny jokesfor the interview?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:36"><subtitle>
But please don't make jokesat the interview.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:39"><subtitle>
<description>both sigh</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:41"><subtitle>
Sorry I broke every pieceof furniture you own.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:43"><subtitle>
-Will 20 dollars cover it?-Don't worry about it. But, yes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:47"><subtitle>
-So, what happens now?-I don't know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:49"><subtitle>
-I have to tell Pickles.-Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:51"><subtitle>
-I'll tell her you and I had a talk.-Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:54"><subtitle>
-And we're getting back together.-Wait, what?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:56"><subtitle>
-But she's a great girl.-No, no.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:58"><subtitle>
But she is a great girl.You just don't know her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:00"><subtitle>
No, Mr. Peanutbutter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:02"><subtitle>
I don't want to get back togetherwith you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:04"><subtitle>
-What?-I think you misunderstood.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:06"><subtitle>
-Then why do you keep doing this?-Why do you keep doing this?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:10"><subtitle>
-Because I love you!-Don't say that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:12"><subtitle>
It's true. I never stopped loving you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:14"><subtitle>
No. We can't do this ever again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:17"><subtitle>
-I'm sorry.-<description>sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:19"><subtitle>
See? I told you you were greatat giving bad news.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:22"><subtitle>
That is not what I wanted to hear.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:28"><subtitle>
BoJack, Biscuits. Biscuits, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:30"><subtitle>
This interview's gonna go down smooth,like a 1995 Zinfandel.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:34"><subtitle>
You ever try one of those '95 zins?Good year for Zinfandels.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:37"><subtitle>
Bad year for Oklahoma federal buildings.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:41"><subtitle>
-M'kay.-Here's how it's gonna go down.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:43"><subtitle>
Red light on the camera goes bloop!I go, "Hey!" You go, "Hey!" I go, "Video?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:46"><subtitle>
You go, "Nah!" I go, "Really?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:47"><subtitle>
You go, "Well..." and you roll methrough the rigamarole.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:50"><subtitle>
-Oh, don't---Don't forget to plug your show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:52"><subtitle>
Then I go, "Wow. This has beenso illuminating. Thank you so much."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:54"><subtitle>
Red light goes boo-de-de-boop,we'll be out of here before Traffic.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:57"><subtitle>
And, yes, I'm talking aboutthe Stephen Soderbergh movie Traffic.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:00"><subtitle>
It's playing on FX tonight,and I'm hoping to catch it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:03"><subtitle>
Love me some Cheadle.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:06"><subtitle>
Am I crazyor was she kind of hitting on me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:08"><subtitle>
Yeah. You guys have a real flirty energy,like Matt Lauer and those magazinecut-outs he now interviews in his kitchen.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:13"><subtitle>
-This should be fun.-Now that's the spirit!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:17"><subtitle>
You gotta show me this video.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:18"><subtitle>
No, I really don't thinkthat's necessary.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:20"><subtitle>
I'll look like an idiotif I don't know what I'm talking about.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:22"><subtitle>
Just let me see it. How bad could it be?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:24"><subtitle>
Cut to: "Ooh, it's really bad!"But, no, seriously, can I see it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:28"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:30"><subtitle>
-<description>BoJack grunting in video</description>-Hey, wow, look at me go.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:32"><subtitle>
-<description>Princess Carolyn's voice</description> BoJack!-Oh. Oh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:34"><subtitle>
Oh, look out, I'm getting really, um...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:37"><subtitle>
Well, this looks like...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:38"><subtitle>
Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:40"><subtitle>
Because I'm actually...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:43"><subtitle>
Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:51"><subtitle>
Diane! What have you been up to?Tell me everything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:54"><subtitle>
Actually, I've been workingon a book of essays--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:56"><subtitle>
Okay, I was obviously asking to be polite,and it's very rude of youto assume that I care.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:59"><subtitle>
I have news that's actually interesting.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:02"><subtitle>
Girl Croosh is pivoting to video,and I want you to be the face.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:07"><subtitle>
-The face?-Of the site.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:08"><subtitle>
Every woman under 40 will tune into hear what you have to say.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:12"><subtitle>
And possibly women over 40,but we have no way of knowingbecause they're invisibleto our site metrics.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:16"><subtitle>
Stefani... no.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:18"><subtitle>
I don't understand.My parents never said no to me growing up,so I'm literally incapableof processing it as a concept.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:23"><subtitle>
I'm a hypocrite. I'm miserableand I make other people miserable.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:27"><subtitle>
I don't know what I'm doing.I can't be a trusted news source,or an authority,or a role model for anybody.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:34"><subtitle>
Uh, no one called you a "role model."Settle down.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:37"><subtitle>
-Oh. Um...-You know what your problem is?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:39"><subtitle>
You hold everyoneto an impossible standard,including yourself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:43"><subtitle>
It's super helpfulfor writing hot-take shakedowns,and clickbait take-downs,but totally toxic for your personal lifeand internalized senseof self-worth, girl.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:52"><subtitle>
But shouldn't we be askingmore of ourselves</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:54"><subtitle>
-and of the people in our lives?-Of course. But we all fail, Diane.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:58"><subtitle>
The world is unforgiving enough as it is.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:01"><subtitle>
The least we could do is find waysto forgive each other and ourselves.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:05"><subtitle>
Well, then maybe we should bemore forgiving in our content,and maybe not publish so many take-downs?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:11"><subtitle>
Oh, Diane.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:15"><subtitle>
- All right, let's bring in the talent.-<description>mumbling</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:18"><subtitle>
-<description>gasps</description>-Hey, is this a good time to talk?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:20"><subtitle>
No, Stuart. This is a very bad time.We're about to shoot the interview.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:23"><subtitle>
Oh, sorry, I haven't memorizedyour schedule.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:26"><subtitle>
-You could write it down.-With what, a quill?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:29"><subtitle>
-Okay, Elbridge Gerry.-What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:31"><subtitle>
Anyway, this lady showed upat the officeand she was being super annoying,so I brought her here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:36"><subtitle>
-What lady? <description>gasps</description>-Hey.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:38"><subtitle>
Why aren't you answering your phone?Why aren't you in North Carolina?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:41"><subtitle>
We're having a bit of a PR crisis.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:43"><subtitle>
As soon as this is settledI will take the first plane there,but this is just not the best time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:47"><subtitle>
Look, if you can't do this, don't do it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:50"><subtitle>
My mom worked all the timeand she never made time for me.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:10:54"><subtitle>
I felt so alone growing up,especially because I never knew my dador my twin brotherbecause our parents broke upwhen we were babies,and wouldn't even talk to each other.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:03"><subtitle>
Oh, Tracy, I had no idea.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:05"><subtitle>
My whole life,all I had was this half of a medallionwith part of a family crest on it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:11"><subtitle>
The crest of a family I'll never know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:14"><subtitle>
-Boring.-Ex-squeeze me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:16"><subtitle>
Sorry, but your story sucks.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:17"><subtitle>
I mean, who wasn't separatedfrom their family as a babyand still wears their half of a medallionin the hopes of one day being reunitedwith their long-lost twin?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:26"><subtitle>
That exact thing happened to meand you don't see me bitching about it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:29"><subtitle>
-God, get over yourself.-Get over yourself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:32"><subtitle>
I didn't realize it was a common thing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:34"><subtitle>
Well, obviously it is,so can you get to your point already?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:38"><subtitle>
I was getting to itif you'd quit talking already.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:41"><subtitle>
My point is, not every woman is supposedto be a mother.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:45"><subtitle>
Maybe you'd be happierif you freed yourselffrom that expectation,and just lived the lifeyou'd clearly rather be living.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:52"><subtitle>
Two minutes to air!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:53"><subtitle>
No, that's not... I'm not...I can't even deal with this right now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:57"><subtitle>
-You need to leave.-All right, let's go.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:00"><subtitle>
She's in one of her moods.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:01"><subtitle>
I still think it's pretty nuttywe both have the left half of a medallion.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:05"><subtitle>
Like, what are the odds?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:06"><subtitle>
Nah, it's a completely different thingwith me. Mine is the right half.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:09"><subtitle>
-So...-Oh, okay.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:12:15"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:23"><subtitle>
Yeah, makeup covered the bruises.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:24"><subtitle>
-Gina, I'm so sorry.-Let's just do the interview, okay?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:27"><subtitle>
-I'm gonna come clean about everything.-What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:29"><subtitle>
Everyone needs to know what I did.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:31"><subtitle>
-<description>bell rings</description>-<description>man</description> Please get in positions.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:32"><subtitle>
No. Don't do that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:33"><subtitle>
Gina, what I did to you--I saw the video and it looked pretty bad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:37"><subtitle>
I'll say it was pretty bad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:38"><subtitle>
-It was assault.-Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:39"><subtitle>
You physically overpowered me,and if there were any justice,you would be in jail right now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:44"><subtitle>
Okay, so...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:45"><subtitle>
But my career,after so many failed attempts,is finally starting to take off.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:49"><subtitle>
I am getting offers, and fan mail,and magazine columnsabout what a good actor I am.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:54"><subtitle>
People know me because of my acting.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:56"><subtitle>
And all that goes away if I'm justthe girl who got chokedby BoJack Horseman.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:01"><subtitle>
I can't lie about this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:02"><subtitle>
I don't want you to be the most notablething that ever happened to me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:06"><subtitle>
I don't want you to be the questionI get asked in interviewsfor the rest of my life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:09"><subtitle>
-Gina, I---You need to do this for me, okay?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:12"><subtitle>
Because I just want this to be over.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:13"><subtitle>
Can we talk about it,maybe after the interview?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:16"><subtitle>
No. I will be civil to you on setwhen we have scenes together,but otherwise, I never wanna thinkabout you again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:22"><subtitle>
-Hey, guys, how are we doing?-So good, Biscuits.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:25"><subtitle>

Let's cut to the chase. That video.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:38"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description> Oh, my God,it's so embarrassing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:42"><subtitle>
-This is all a misunderstanding.-I mean, it's kind of hilarious.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:46"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:13:48"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:50"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:53"><subtitle>
And Gina, you look terrified.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:55"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:57"><subtitle>
-Oh, thank God.-Yep, actors.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:00"><subtitle>

You wanted to see me, Mr. Fondle?</subtitle>

<description>Henry</description> I must make love to you.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:14:44"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description> You mean to my brain,because I have such good ideas.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:48"><subtitle>
Thanks for the encouragement.I never got that at my last job.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:51"><subtitle>
<description>Henry</description> Nice boobs.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:52"><subtitle>
That's exactly right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:54"><subtitle>
Those guys were nice,but they were total boobs.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:57"><subtitle>
Anyway, I'm gonna go reviewthe third quarter budgetwith our diagnostics team.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:08"><subtitle>
<description>Henry</description> Now entering sleep mode.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:10"><subtitle>
You wanna sleep with me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:12"><subtitle>
That is not a modeI'm comfortable with, Mr. Fondle.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:14"><subtitle>
<description>Henry</description> Please connect to power source!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:16"><subtitle>
<description>gasps</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:18"><subtitle>
So first, he saidI had insufficient power...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:20"><subtitle>
Wow.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:21"><subtitle>
Which I have never heard him sayto a man.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:23"><subtitle>
And then he asked me to "connect"to his "power source."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:26"><subtitle>
Did you feel physically threatened?Was there any implication of assault?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:30"><subtitle>
Not assault, but he did make a mentionof "low battery".</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:33"><subtitle>
It is never acceptable to threatenan employee with battery at any level.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:37"><subtitle>
What time is it right now?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:38"><subtitle>
For female employeesof one popular website,the answer is Sexual Harassment O'Clock!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:44"><subtitle>
What started with the allegationsof one junior executivehas quickly snowballedinto an avalanche of accusation,as women at every level have come forwardwith their own harrowing storiesof what happenswhen the big handmeets the little hand.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:00"><subtitle>
He said he wanted to "...get all upin my guts with his penisand ejaculate inside me."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:06"><subtitle>
At the time, I just thoughtit was typical corporate banter,but now I'm like, uh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:12"><subtitle>
Look, obviously,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:13"><subtitle>
men should not be engagingin predatory behavior at the office,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:17"><subtitle>
but I'm worried now the pendulum'sgonna swing too far in the other extreme</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:21"><subtitle>
where they'll be held accountablefor that behavior, and that's not ideal.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:24"><subtitle>
Uh, Henry Fondle is a sex robot,and he should not be a CEOof any company.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:31"><subtitle>
<description>reporter</description> When you say "sex robot,"you're speaking metaphorically, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:36"><subtitle>
No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:38"><subtitle>
The board has taken decisive actionto remove Henry Fondle</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:42"><subtitle>
by placing himon an indefinite paid leave.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:44"><subtitle>
Meanwhile, we will be scaling back,canceling our slate of streaming seriesand refocusing on our original missionof being a website you can go to</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:52"><subtitle>
if you don't know what time it is,that also doesn't harass anyone.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:55"><subtitle>
This is a great day for the womenof this company,</subtitle>

And all we can do is try to doless bad stuff and more good stuff,but you're never going to be good.Because you're not bad.</subtitle>

So, you need to stop using thatas an excuse.</subtitle>
