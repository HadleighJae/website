</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:23"><subtitle>
So, I drove to the planetarium,and I found her passed out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:26"><subtitle>

But that's who she was. Who I was.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:56"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:00:58"><subtitle>

And Sarah Lynn followed me downbecause she thought I was a safe place.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:07"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:03:56"><subtitle>
So, when I went to the country clubfor Sheila's luncheon...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:00"><subtitle>
Yes. Let it out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:01"><subtitle>
I had to wear the same suitI had just worn to Sandra's tea party.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:05"><subtitle>
-Yeah.-<description>woman</description> Oh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:06"><subtitle>
I think of that as my rock bottom. <description>sobs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:10"><subtitle>
Denise, thank youfor sharing your story. So brave.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:14"><subtitle>
Denise, we are powerless</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:16"><subtitle>
-over our addictions-Uh-huh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:17"><subtitle>
We have a saying in rehab,"Everyone takes a different road</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:20"><subtitle>
to get to the same city,Soberopolis, USA."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:23"><subtitle>
Hold on a sec. What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:24"><subtitle>
BoJack, maybe you could tell uswhen was the first time you drank?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:27"><subtitle>
When wasn't the first time I drank?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:29"><subtitle>
-Am I right?-<description>all laugh</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:36"><subtitle>
Your last day's tomorrow.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:37"><subtitle>
You think you're readyto go back into the world?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:39"><subtitle>
I do. I feel good, I feel clear.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:42"><subtitle>
You know, just because you cleanedthe tobacco out of your teethdon't mean it's your wedding day,pardon the expression.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:47"><subtitle>
I don't believe that is an expression.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:48"><subtitle>
I notice you tend to deflectwhenever I ask youabout the source of your addiction.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:52"><subtitle>
I don't deflect.Hey, is that a new tie? Because I love it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:55"><subtitle>
You understand a joke about deflectionis still a deflection, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:59"><subtitle>
I came here to take responsibilityfor myself,and all I keep hearing is,"It's not your fault,you are powerless over your addiction."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:06"><subtitle>
-That is the first step.-And while we're at it, why 12 steps?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:09"><subtitle>
That is way too many.Nobody wants to do 12 of anything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:12"><subtitle>
Did you see 12 Years a Slaveand think, "Twelve. That's a short numberof years to be a slave"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:16"><subtitle>
-You're deflecting again.-I'm here because I made choices.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:19"><subtitle>
Nobody made me drink.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:20"><subtitle>
My addiction didn't pull a knife on meand say, "Hey, bub! Drink this alcohol,or I'm gonna strangle you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:25"><subtitle>
After I put down this knife,which now seems unnecessary."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:28"><subtitle>
-We have a saying in the sober community.-No kidding.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:30"><subtitle>
"We want what our addictionswant us to want,in the same way that our futureis just a house built from the materialsof our present on the blueprintthat is our past."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:39"><subtitle>
See, usually the point of sayingsis they illustrate complicated conceptsvia straightforward allegory.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:44"><subtitle>
I really admirethat your sayings don't do that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:46"><subtitle>
If you don't wanna be here,you don't have to wait until tomorrow.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:49"><subtitle>
The gate code is 12,for the number of steps,then my mom's birthday,which is March 4th, '56.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:55"><subtitle>
So, the gate codeis one, two, three, four, five, six?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:57"><subtitle>
You can leave whenever you'd like.But is that really what you want?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:02"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description> No.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:07:24"><subtitle>
-Maybe it's a sign it's not working, huh?-BoJack...</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:07:31"><subtitle>
-either you're a lost cause...-<description>all gasp</description></subtitle>
