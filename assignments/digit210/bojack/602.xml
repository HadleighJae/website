<description>Mr. Peanutbutter</description>If there's one thing I've learned</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:14"><subtitle>
from this crazy mambo called life,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:17"><subtitle>
it's that anyone can be a birthday father,but it takes a heart full of birthdays</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:22"><subtitle>
to be a true Birthday Dad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:24"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:31"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:00:31"><subtitle>
-<description>snoring</description>-Please tell me you guys see that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:34"><subtitle>
Oh! Loo-- looks great! Uh, love it!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:36"><subtitle>
What's wrong with your face?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:37"><subtitle>
I just don't buy it,Director Flea Daniels.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:39"><subtitle>
That just doesn't look like the honest,trustworthy face of a Birthday Dad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:43"><subtitle>
What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:44"><subtitle>
This is clearly the faceof a guy who did something terrible,like, I don't know,cheat on his girlfriendwith his ex-wife a couple of times,and instead of confessingto his girlfriend, asked her to marry him,so now they're engaged,and she still has no idea.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:55"><subtitle>
Can't you see he's racked with guilt?It's all over his very handsome face!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:58"><subtitle>
Did Birthday Dad cheat on his girlfriend?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:00"><subtitle>
No, I'm just saying he looks like he did.We have to re-edit the scene.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:04"><subtitle>
No. You've been dragging this outwith your ridiculous tweaks and demandsfor what is the stupidest premiseI've ever seen.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:11"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:12"><subtitle>
Well, sure, I know that,and you know that, but does the industry?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:14"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:26"><subtitle>
Everyone wanted to work with her,everyone!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:30"><subtitle>
She had more overall deal offersthan an OshKosh B'gosh outlet.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:33"><subtitle>
-Then a baby fell out of her!-<description>Princess Carolyn</description> Well, that's--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:36"><subtitle>
<description>Amanda</description> She took three weeks off.Three weeks!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:38"><subtitle>
And when she came back,Tumbleweeds, Crickets...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:40"><subtitle>
And those are just two of the projectsshe wasn't offered</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:43"><subtitle>
because the studios were dubiousabout her priorities.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:47"><subtitle>
-Do you have the right priorities?-Of course I do!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:50"><subtitle>
Then prove it!</subtitle>
