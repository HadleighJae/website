<timestamp time="00:03:17"><subtitle>
Rehab is making me write a letterto a friend</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:19"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:21"><subtitle>
I hear it did wondersfor the Zodiac killer.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:24"><subtitle>
Anyway, rehab's going fine.A lot of hikes and movie nights and yoga,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:28"><subtitle>
and I think next week,we're doing a color war.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:32"><subtitle>
And it's good that I'm here,and it's good that I'm not drinking</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:35"><subtitle>
or taking pills, but I keep thinkingabout how this isn't real life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:38"><subtitle>
It's summer camp. Temporary. Easy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:42"><subtitle>
As nice as this is, I know that somedayI'll have to go back to the real world.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:05:08"><subtitle>
-<description>gulps</description> What?-Meanwhile,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:09"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:15"><subtitle>
So croosh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:16"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:19"><subtitle>
for a few feel-good stories?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:21"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:30"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:05:32"><subtitle>
What about that girl who opened upa lemonade standto pay for her dad's cancer treatment?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:35"><subtitle>
How is that a feel-good story?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:37"><subtitle>
"Hey, America! We're the only developednation without subsidized healthcare,so this child joinedthe workforce in a desperate bidto keep her father alive!"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:44"><subtitle>
Okay. How 'bout this?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:45"><subtitle>
Local cameraman has a prettygood thing going,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:48"><subtitle>
where he gets to travelall over the country</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:49"><subtitle>
and fool around in hotel rooms withhis beautiful, smart, feisty producer...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:53"><subtitle>
and he's pretty surethis passionate, intelligent,warrior for truth likes it too,so maybe these two knuckleheadsshould swallow their pride for a secondand make some feel-good videos.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:09"><subtitle>

<description>BoJack's voice</description> Dear Diane, hello.I am writing you another letter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:14"><subtitle>
Today sucks. There's this new lady here,Beverly, and she took my snack kit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:18"><subtitle>
And that is so classic Beverly.Probably. I just met her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:23"><subtitle>
The whole point of the snack kitsis they're communal, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:25"><subtitle>
They're these bags full of snacksthat we take on our morning hikes,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:27"><subtitle>
and we put them together the night beforeas, like, a team-building thing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:32"><subtitle>
Yesterday, I decided to throw an extra bagof candied nuts into a snack kit,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:36"><subtitle>
something just for me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:37"><subtitle>
And I marked my bag with a "B"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:38"><subtitle>
so I'd know which one to grabin the morning.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:40"><subtitle>
"B" for "BoJack."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:41"><subtitle>
-<description>groans angrily</description>-But then today, I see Beverly,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:42"><subtitle>
who, again, just got here,waltzing around the house</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:45"><subtitle>
with my snack kit, saying, "Oh, somebodymade a special kit just for me!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:49"><subtitle>
B for Beverly!I must have a secret admirer!"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:52"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:54"><subtitle>
-<description>shivering</description>-The story of my life</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:55"><subtitle>
is that I never get anything nice.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:57"><subtitle>
You'd think that I'd learn to adjustmy expectations by now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:59"><subtitle>
But, no. Once again,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:01"><subtitle>
I was the idiotwho got my hopes up about candied nuts,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:04"><subtitle>
and now I am disappointedwith no one to blame but myself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:09"><subtitle>

</timestamp>

Welcome!Here at Whitewhale Consolidated Interests,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:35"><subtitle>
we do it all through the free-market magicof the Whitewhale Way!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:40"><subtitle>
<description>both</description> That's right, Mr. Whitewhale!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:42"><subtitle>
Who? Why? Where?Whence forth are you two,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:44"><subtitle>
and how did you manifest in my office?Be gone, ghastly ghouls!</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:11:54"><subtitle>
And I'm Ollie, the Oligopoly.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:57"><subtitle>
You summoned us here to tell your newemployees about the Whitewhale Way!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:01"><subtitle>
Well, best be quick about it,you unholy apparitions.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:06"><subtitle>
The Whitewhale Way was developedby Ezekiel Whitewhale,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:09"><subtitle>
who started small with a modest petroleumrefinery he inherited from his father.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:14"><subtitle>
<description>Ollie</description>One day he looked around and said,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:17"><subtitle>
"Wait one minute!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:18"><subtitle>
While I'm refining this oil, someone elseis getting rich drilling it,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:22"><subtitle>
and another someone's sellin' itto the common commuter!"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:25"><subtitle>
So, he bought his own rigand opened a chain of gas stations.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:28"><subtitle>
By controlling both the meansof production and the delivery system,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:32"><subtitle>
Ezekiel cornered the marketand choked out the competition</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:35"><subtitle>
until they had no choicebut to sell to him, too!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:38"><subtitle>
And that's vertical integration! <description>burps</description></subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:12:54"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:11"><subtitle>
-I guess so. Unless it isn't it for us?-What do you mean?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:16"><subtitle>
What if we did one more videoabout anything we wantedand posted it on the website before theyrealize we still have all the passwords?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:23"><subtitle>
-We could do a story about Whitewhale.-Oh, yeah!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:26"><subtitle>
Now, there's a feel-good story.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:28"><subtitle>
Me feeling good about takin'those assholes down!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:42"><subtitle>
Diane, this is Isabel,star reporter at The Tribune.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:45"><subtitle>
She's been hunting Whitewhale for years.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:47"><subtitle>
-Call me... Isabel.-Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:52"><subtitle>
All my days, the beast has haunted me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:54"><subtitle>
The hunt consumes my every waking moment.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:57"><subtitle>
You might even say Whitewhale is my...green light at the end of the dock.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:03"><subtitle>
-What?-That's a Gatsby reference. Read a book.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:06"><subtitle>
Isabel, be nice.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:07"><subtitle>
I wish I had the energy,but my obsession has ruined me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:10"><subtitle>
Destroyed my relationships,obliterated my career. And for nothing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:14"><subtitle>
I had one contact on the warehouse floor,Matt Minnowman.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:18"><subtitle>
-Hmm.-Then he disappeared.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:20"><subtitle>
-Maybe there's your story.-Not your story?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:22"><subtitle>
Mm. My editor thought I was getting"too invested" in the Whitewhale beat,so he moved meto the Holiday Gift Guide desk.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:28"><subtitle>
Now the search for the season's hot toytorments my waking days.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:32"><subtitle>
Are spirographs the new fidget spinners?The answer eludes me at every turn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:41"><subtitle>
<description>Diane</description> I can't believe it. We got a lead.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:43"><subtitle>
Hey, do you wanna walk back to my place?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:45"><subtitle>
Are you kidding? It's so cold.How is it snowing in October?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:48"><subtitle>
There are basically two seasons here:bitter winter, unbearable humidity.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:01"><subtitle>
-so I'll cut right to the chase.-<description>Guy</description> Oh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:03"><subtitle>
I started writing "BH" on my snack kitsto clear up any confusion</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:07"><subtitle>
about who the extra nuts are for.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:10"><subtitle>
But now Beverly thinks "BH"stands for Beverly, here-ya-go.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:13"><subtitle>
"Beverly here ya go"?Why would the "H" stand for--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:16"><subtitle>
-<description>Guy and Diane moan</description>-You know what? Doesn't matter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:19"><subtitle>
The dumbest part is that Beverly doesn'teven eat candied nuts.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:22"><subtitle>
-<description>Diane moaning</description>-She's allergic.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:23"><subtitle>
So she usually just ends up</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:24"><subtitle>
-giving her nuts to me.-<description>Guy snores</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:26"><subtitle>
Doctor Champ would probably saythat means something.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:28"><subtitle>
That the universe has a way of looking outfor us if we just stop fighting it, but...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:32"><subtitle>
I don't know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:33"><subtitle>
Anyway, I guess it's working.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:44"><subtitle>
I was following up on this Matt Minnowman.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:46"><subtitle>
Turns out there was an "accident"at the warehouse.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:48"><subtitle>
-What?-He stayed late to finish some work.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:50"><subtitle>
"Look at me, I'm just doing some work.It's no big deal."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:52"><subtitle>
Next morning, they found him dead.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:54"><subtitle>
Oh, shit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:55"><subtitle>
This guy was trying to get the word outabout working conditions,and then he died in the warehouse.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:01"><subtitle>
I got the names of some coworkers,let's get our handson the security footage.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:04"><subtitle>
Did you know your cerealwas made by Whitewhale?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:06"><subtitle>
I threw it out to be safe.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:07"><subtitle>
Microchips-- Oh, my God,you're looking at me like I'm crazy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:09"><subtitle>
You think I'm obsessed.Am I totally scaring you off right now?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:12"><subtitle>
No. You're glowing.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:17:16"><subtitle>
<description>keyboard clacking</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:19"><subtitle>
We were working 17-hour days.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:21"><subtitle>
We were spread thinnerthan a shitty New York slice of pizzaand working harder than the '96 Bulls.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:28"><subtitle>
<description>Guy</description> Okay, so Matt's stationed here...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:30"><subtitle>
So, what, he walked to the other sideof the room just to die?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:33"><subtitle>
That's where he died, all right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:35"><subtitle>
Management left his body out thereon the floor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:37"><subtitle>
Almost like it was a warningto the other workers.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:40"><subtitle>
Wow.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:42"><subtitle>
I just don't think you can attribute itto intentional cruelty.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:44"><subtitle>
-It's callousness.-Can't it be both?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:46"><subtitle>
Whitewhale's not evil.They're just capitalists.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:48"><subtitle>
What's the difference?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:49"><subtitle>
From New York Times,I'm Michael Barbaro. Today--</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:18:07"><subtitle>
-Hey. I got you something.-What? Shut up!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:12"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:18:13"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:18"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:19"><subtitle>
Is this your way of asking meto move to Chicago?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:22"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description> No. Not everything is some kindof secret underhanded conspiracy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:27"><subtitle>
-Sometimes a coat's just a coat.-Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:29"><subtitle>
But I also don't know why it's so obviousthat you go back to LA.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:32"><subtitle>
-I live there.-But there's nothing for you there.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:35"><subtitle>
Excuse me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:36"><subtitle>
I just don't understandwhy you're so into punishing yourself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:38"><subtitle>
I am not--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:39"><subtitle>
And it's not just yourself,because every time you get cold,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:42"><subtitle>
-guess who has to give you his coat.-Oh, sorry, does that inconvenience you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:46"><subtitle>
No. <description>sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:47"><subtitle>
I just don't knowwhy I should sufferbecause you have this ideologicalobjection to feeling good.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:52"><subtitle>
Are you-- I would love to feel good.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:54"><subtitle>
What a luxury. How nice for youthat you can do thatwhile the world burns around you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:59"><subtitle>
This is not even about the world,this is about you and me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:01"><subtitle>
"You and me"?What's "you and me"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:03"><subtitle>
-Don't---No, no, tell me, Guy, please,because I would love some clarification.Am I your girlfriend?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:08"><subtitle>
Am I the, um,"you know, woman that I work with"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:11"><subtitle>
-Come on, Diane.-What is this?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:13"><subtitle>
I... Just take the coat.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:17"><subtitle>
I think I should go back to the hotel.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:19:43"><subtitle>
I didn't know if you'd come.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:44"><subtitle>
Well, we got a job to do, right?Could get chilly up there.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:51"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:57"><subtitle>
You're not gonna stop us.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:58"><subtitle>
I don't want to stop you,I just said that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:01"><subtitle>
See, when you put out stories about usbeing "evil" or "callous"or whoever the bad guy in Harry Potter is,people think our business is uncompromisedby morality and our stock goes up.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:13"><subtitle>
So, it doesn't bother your shareholdersthat one of your employees diedin a work-related accident?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:18"><subtitle>
-What accident?-Matt Minnowman's body was foundin your warehouse.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:22"><subtitle>
Oh, him, sure!But that was no accident. I killed him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:25"><subtitle>
-What?-I murdered him!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:27"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:29"><subtitle>
Well, I didn't murder-of-crows him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:31"><subtitle>
He took too many bathroom breaksand encouraged the other employeesto take bathroom breaks as well.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:36"><subtitle>
And you're not worried it's goingto get out that you killed an employee?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:40"><subtitle>
Like in the videowe're shooting right now?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:42"><subtitle>
Didn't you hear? Congress just passeda bill legalizing murder if you're rich.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:47"><subtitle>
-No, they didn't-- Oh, my God, they did!-What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:50"><subtitle>
Hold on. Just because it passedthe House doesn't mean the Senate will--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:52"><subtitle>
Really, Diane?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:53"><subtitle>

All right, sure, but the Supreme Court.Okay, I get it.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:04"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:08"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:15"><subtitle>
You have been such a good thing for me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:19"><subtitle>
But I can't be with youif you're the only good thing in my life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:24"><subtitle>

</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:31"><subtitle>

<description>BoJack's voice</description> Dear Diane,it was Beverly's last day yesterday.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:44"><subtitle>
Everyone is real excited for her,but she spent the whole day sulking</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:48"><subtitle>
because she never found outwho her secret admirer was.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:51"><subtitle>
Frankly, it was getting pretty annoying,so finally I just say,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:54"><subtitle>
"It was me! I'm in love with you!"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:56"><subtitle>
And she goes,"Oh. I was hoping it was Mario."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:00"><subtitle>
And then she starts crying.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:03"><subtitle>
And everyone looks at me like, "Way to go,you made Beverly cry on her last day."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:08"><subtitle>
So, the thing I keep thinking about is...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:11"><subtitle>
was it worth it for Beverly to be happyfor a little bit,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:14"><subtitle>
even though it ended up sad?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:16"><subtitle>
Or would it have been betterif the whole thing never happened?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:19"><subtitle>
Every time someone leaves rehab...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:20"><subtitle>
it makes you thinkabout your own progress.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:23"><subtitle>
Some days it feels like you're notprogressing at all, other days you think,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:26"><subtitle>
"Well, maybe a little."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:28"><subtitle>
The main thing I think aboutis how stupid I am</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:29"><subtitle>
that I didn't do this sooner.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:31"><subtitle>
I wasted so many years being miserablebecause I assumed</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:34"><subtitle>
that was the only way to be.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:37"><subtitle>
But I don't wanna do that anymore.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:40"><subtitle>
Also, am I crazy or have I gottenreally good at writing letters?</subtitle>

-Hey.-Hey.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:53"><subtitle>
I was thinking about these grilled cheesesandwiches I used to make,back when I first moved to LA.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:58"><subtitle>
-What?-I was dirt-broke,and I had no friends and no job,and I got obsessed with perfectingthe art of the grilled cheese sandwich.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:05"><subtitle>
-Makes sense.-Partly because it was cheap,but also because while I was doing it,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:10"><subtitle>
I wasn't thinking about how depressingmy life was.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:12"><subtitle>
Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:13"><subtitle>
So, on the plane I was thinking,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:15"><subtitle>
I should makeanother grilled cheese sandwichbecause I haven't in a long time,but I love themand they always make me feel betterabout things.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:24"><subtitle>
-Look, Diane, I gotta---And the thing aboutmaking your own grilled cheese sandwichis you can do it anywhere. You know?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:32"><subtitle>
Yeah?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:33"><subtitle>
Yeah.So, I guess that's another good thing.</subtitle>
