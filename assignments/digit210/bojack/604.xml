</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:51"><subtitle>
Uh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:52"><subtitle>
Don't worry. We sent himwith a trained sober companion.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:55"><subtitle>
He'll keep him out of trouble.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:59"><subtitle>
This is Eduardo.He's here to keep me out of trouble.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:01"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description> Say, aren't youone of those fainting goats?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:04"><subtitle>
<description>laughs</description> Only if I panic.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:07"><subtitle>
So, what makes you panic?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:08"><subtitle>
Nothing. The whole point ishe doesn't panic. Sober companion.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:11"><subtitle>
You know what makes me panic?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:13"><subtitle>
Most of the timeI'm an ocean-levels-rising guy,but sometimes I like to dwellon the fact thatthere will always be invisible wallsbetween myself and those who claimto know me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:24"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description> That sure is nerve-racking,but the only thing that makes me panicis the thoughtthat I might someday drink again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:30"><subtitle>
-A toast to that never happening!-<description>whimpers and thuds</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:27"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:33"><subtitle>
No, she said she feltshe was being watched all day.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:37"><subtitle>
Impossible! I'm there around the clock,observing her every move.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:01"><subtitle>

It's not.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:35"><subtitle>
-Lights---Wait!</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:07:36"><subtitle>
Before Robot House assaults uswith the harsh, unforgiving glareof our energy-efficient bulbs,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:41"><subtitle>
I need to tell you this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:42"><subtitle>
But it's so dark in here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:44"><subtitle>
What I'm about to confess is so shameful,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:46"><subtitle>
I can only admit itin the cover of shadow.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:48"><subtitle>
Don't be silly. Lights, on!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:50"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:54"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:07:55"><subtitle>
-<description>voice breaking</description> You cheated on me?-I am so sorry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:58"><subtitle>
-How could you do this?-It was the worst mistake of my life!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:02"><subtitle>
And I once played Twisterwith Bryan Singerat Kevin Spacey's partyfor Andy Dick's early parole.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:07"><subtitle>
-Ugh!-I've been in the Thunder Room every nightfor months trying to swallow my shame.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:12"><subtitle>
But I can't. And I've apparently beenso racked with guilt I left the door open.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:15"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:29"><subtitle>
Because I am hurt,and I am confused, and I am angry,and nobody told me there was going to bean encore, so I just went home and...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:35"><subtitle>
-<description>groans</description>-Why am I even talking to you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:37"><subtitle>
-I need my best friend. I'm calling Ilana!-<description>gasps</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:42"><subtitle>
But, honestly,can Ilana even relate to me anymore?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:45"><subtitle>
Since she got thatnew Sunday-to-Thursday jobshe's turned into a realsee-you-next-Friday.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:51"><subtitle>
I never thought I'd say this,but sometimes I feel like I prefermy other friend Ilana.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:57"><subtitle>
Sometimes it's just easier to talkto a person who has nothing else going on.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:00"><subtitle>
-What?-Please don't tell the Ilanas about this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:02"><subtitle>
I'm gonna tell everybody about this.I'm a Gemini.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:06"><subtitle>
No! Think of my family!They need me to be strong right now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:19"><subtitle>
Excuse me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:20"><subtitle>
Every time I get trappedin a conversation with Captain,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:22"><subtitle>
I think, "If I was married to this guy,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:25"><subtitle>
I would gnaw my own hand offjust to get the ring off my body."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:28"><subtitle>
