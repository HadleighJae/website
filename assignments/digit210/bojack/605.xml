<timestamp time="00:00:09"><subtitle>
In my line of work,I meet a lot of big names.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:39"><subtitle>
So, here's me, thinking,"What an opportunityto write for the most finely-calibratedensemble cast on television!"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:44"><subtitle>
It's like a bowling alleywith you people.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:46"><subtitle>
Setting up pins and knocking them down.I should be so lucky.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:49"><subtitle>
-Uh.-I know it's no secretthat you and Herb had some friction,and he left the showunder not-great circumstances.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:55"><subtitle>
Now I'm coming at this from a place of...this is your house,and I'm a guest, all right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:00"><subtitle>
The magic of Horsin' Aroundis not Herb Kazzaz or Danny Bananas.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:03"><subtitle>
I know why people buy the Big Mac.I'm not here to change the recipe.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:00"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:06:09"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description> You've already re-uppedthree times.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:11"><subtitle>
This place is for people in crisis.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:13"><subtitle>
In crisis of being too cool, maybe.Right, Karmen?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:16"><subtitle>
-I-If I say yes, I can see my baby?-Karmen, no.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:21"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:06:23"><subtitle>
-The leeches have your baby now.-Oh, yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:27"><subtitle>
Ah. Classic Karm.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:28"><subtitle>
It's natural to be hesitant.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:30"><subtitle>
When I first checked out of rehab,I was terrified.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:33"><subtitle>
I knew a single drop of alcoholwould send me down a ruinous path.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:37"><subtitle>
-But I found my way.-Found your way back to rehab.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:39"><subtitle>
-Ah, I'll miss our little comedy routines.-"Our"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:42"><subtitle>
A lot of people leave this place,and I think, "They're not gonna make it."Like Denise, for example.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:48"><subtitle>
But you?You've done the work, and you're ready.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:51"><subtitle>
You're a special case, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:53"><subtitle>
-I am?-Of course you are.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:58"><subtitle>
Huh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:59"><subtitle>
<description>Sharona</description> Oh, boy,did he do a number on you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:04"><subtitle>
He was actually very nice.You know, I want things to be easy on set.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:07"><subtitle>
And I think Dannyrepresents a fresh start.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:09"><subtitle>
-Is that why you got Herb fired?-Hey, I'm not the one who--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:12"><subtitle>
I can't do your hairif you're gonna move your head so much.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:15"><subtitle>
There was nothing I could do about Herb.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:16"><subtitle>
If it wasn't for me,they would've canceled the whole show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:19"><subtitle>
And then where would you go?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:20"><subtitle>
Who's gonna hirea hair-and-makeup lady with shaky hands?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:22"><subtitle>
-My hands only shake when I don't drink.-Be sure to put that on your résumé.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:26"><subtitle>
You're just bitter because I'm the onlyperson who can drink as much as you do.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:07:54"><subtitle>
And there's worse to come,unless somebody can slurp upall that ice cream!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
