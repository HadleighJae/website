-Oh. Hello, Jorge.-I have some news. It's about your mother.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:17"><subtitle>
Oh, is the news that you're marrying her,inserting yourself into our familyand ruining my life?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:22"><subtitle>
Because I already heard that newslike 25 years ago, Jorge.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:26"><subtitle>
-I didn't come to your home to fight.-Then joke's on youbecause you didn't come to my home at all.</subtitle>

-I just sleep on the couch...-<description>Jorge sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:34"><subtitle>
-...since you and Mom gave me the boot.-That was ten years ago.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:37"><subtitle>
Which, by the way,is the only thing you ever gave me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:40"><subtitle>
I gave you my name,and you have clearly wasted it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:43"><subtitle>
Do you know what the Chavez namestands for?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:45"><subtitle>
Yes, Jorge.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:47"><subtitle>
Chavez! C for cerebral!H for high-minded! A for analytical!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:53"><subtitle>
V for veracious! E for efficacious!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:56"><subtitle>
And Z for zealously practical.</subtitle>

Feels like a cheat on the Z.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:04:00"><subtitle>
Todd, your mother needs your help.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:02"><subtitle>
Well, then instead of sending her husband,she should have asked me herself,if it's so important to her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:06"><subtitle>
-She's in a coma.-A rudeness coma?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:09"><subtitle>
No, a regular coma.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:12"><subtitle>
Oh, my God! Why didn't you open with that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:14"><subtitle>
Please. Your mother needs a kidney.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:16"><subtitle>
I put her on the donor waiting list,but if you're a match...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:20"><subtitle>
Oh. I'm sorry.Of course I would give Mom my kidney.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:23"><subtitle>
-Then there's no time to waste---"Would" give her my kidney.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:27"><subtitle>
"Would." You need to workon your listening skills.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:30"><subtitle>
I sold my extra kidney just last week.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:32"><subtitle>
-Why?-I wanted to buy these sock puppets.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:36"><subtitle>
You sold your kidney for... <description>groans</description>I'm sorry I came.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:40"><subtitle>
If you'd like to visit your mother--</subtitle>

Princess Carolyn, this is a catastrophe.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:02"><subtitle>
-You know it.-This strike has shut down the whole city!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:05"><subtitle>
Assistants want respect?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:07"><subtitle>
If we respect them, how are we supposedto work through our rage issues?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:10"><subtitle>
On our spouses and children?That doesn't seem fair.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:13"><subtitle>
There's gotta be a better way!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:15"><subtitle>
Uh, maybe we could circumventgiving the assistants what they wantby giving them what they think they want.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:21"><subtitle>
You know, like how we satiate TV creatorsby giving them little vanity cardsat the end of episodes,then sell the shows to streaming networksthat auto-skip the end creditsso no one even sees the vanity cards!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:31"><subtitle>
Yeah, yeah, that's good.But what do assistants want?iTunes gift cards? Amazon gift cards?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:36"><subtitle>
I honestly can't think of another thingan assistant would want.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:38"><subtitle>
When I was an assistant,the only thing I wantedwas not to be an assistant anymore.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:09"><subtitle>
Listen, I've been tryingto get in touch with you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:12"><subtitle>
I got a call from this mental healthadvocacy group.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:14"><subtitle>
Those guys are jizzin' their pantsover your heroic admissionof your struggle with depression,and they wanna help youshare your story with the world.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:21"><subtitle>
The world, huh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:22"><subtitle>
I wanted to set up a meeting,but my assistant went on strike,and phones, for me, are, like, what?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:29"><subtitle>
Even if you had your assistant,it wouldn't do any good.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:31"><subtitle>
My reps' assistantsare all on strike, too.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:33"><subtitle>
Oh, bummer. Guess there's no wayto get in touch then.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:36"><subtitle>

Holiday party, huh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:03"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:06"><subtitle>
-Hi, I'm Diane. This is Guy.-How you doin'?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:09"><subtitle>
Oh! Are you ready for introductionsor are you still processingthe whole being kidnappedacross state lines?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:14"><subtitle>
I'm sorry, what?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:15"><subtitle>
We're breakinginto the Whitewhale building.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:17"><subtitle>
-Why?-To get back my kidney and save Momand prove to youthat I'm not just a wacky screw-upwho engages primarilyin goofy whimsical mess-arounds.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:26"><subtitle>
-How did you get me on the plane?-We did a Weekend at Bernie's.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:31"><subtitle>
-<description>groans</description>-As I was saying,tonight's the Whitewhaleemployee holiday party.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:35"><subtitle>
Security will be tight, but you can usemy employee ID to get in,because I'm technicallystill on the payroll.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:39"><subtitle>
Wait, you didn't quit?We haven't worked there in months.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:42"><subtitle>
Nobody's noticed!They keep sending me checks.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:44"><subtitle>
Cashing them is my way of very graduallytaking down the man from the inside.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:48"><subtitle>
Hey. C-- can we sidebar for a minute?Is this really the best use of your time?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:52"><subtitle>
You've been beating yourself upabout how slowly the book's going. So...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:55"><subtitle>
But the book is about meand my life, so by living my life,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:58"><subtitle>
I am in fact working on the book.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:00"><subtitle>
You don't have to write this bookif you don't want to.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:02"><subtitle>
Of course I want to.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:03"><subtitle>
Okay. I'm just saying, since you started,you've been pretty down.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:06"><subtitle>
-Not yourself. Diane---Actually, pretty down is myself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:09"><subtitle>
Can we talk about this later?We're being rude.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:11"><subtitle>
Why don't you offer themone of your fancy beers?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:14"><subtitle>
So, all we need to dois get into the party,figure out where the kidneys are,find my kidney, and sneak out,all without drawing attentionto ourselves.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:24"><subtitle>
And be careful, becauseif Jeremiah Whitewhale catches you,he can legally murder you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:28"><subtitle>
Now, can I get anyone an imperial stout?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:30"><subtitle>
The barley was from Portland, Maine,but the brewery is in Portland, Oregon!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:33"><subtitle>
This plan is ludicrous.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:35"><subtitle>
Hey, maybe insteadof criticizing everythinglike you've done my entire life,you can get on board?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:40"><subtitle>
It's gonna work out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:41"><subtitle>
Things don't just work out, Todd!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:43"><subtitle>
Of course they do!I don't know why you're so negative!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:46"><subtitle>
Do you want to help Mom,or do you wanna just go backto the hospital and wait?</subtitle>

Yeah. This is not about that.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:11:01"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:14"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:11:16"><subtitle>
I'd have to think about it.I've never rea--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:18"><subtitle>
You'd get overpaid to read scripts,company credit card,and a parking spot in the good garage.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:23"><subtitle>
-Um...-Plus, your own assistant.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:26"><subtitle>
-An... assistant?-<description>thunder rumbling</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:29"><subtitle>
-That is, of course, if the strike ends.-<description>giggles</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:32"><subtitle>
Well, that's a very generous offer,but I'd have to talk it overwith my colleagues.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:38"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:14:24"><subtitle>
Doctor Champ, what is your plan?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:26"><subtitle>
Just gotta drink enough to be steady.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:28"><subtitle>
Then, you take me back to Pastichesand keep me out of trouble.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:31"><subtitle>
That way, you don't have to go homeand I can be a good therapy horse.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:35"><subtitle>
All my clients get sober, I am a winner,put my picture on a magazine. <description>slurps</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:39"><subtitle>
Look, I can't let you go back there drunk.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:41"><subtitle>
You don't care about me!You're scared of this guy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:47"><subtitle>
You can't help anybody elseunless you're honest with yourself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:50"><subtitle>
-Know what I mean?-No. I never know what you mean.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:53"><subtitle>
In fact, maybe I wouldn't be so scaredif you'd given me real therapyover the last six monthsinstead of just plying mewith folksy aphorisms.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:59"><subtitle>
I'm not a therapist! I'm a therapy horse,a subtle but legallyimportant distinction.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:04"><subtitle>
Besides, you wouldn't acceptreal therapy from me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:07"><subtitle>
Oh, and why's that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:08"><subtitle>
Gee, I don't know,maybe because I'm a horse,so I remind you of your father,so you simultaneously resent meand crave my approval,an approval which,ironically, if granted--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:17"><subtitle>
Yeah, I would dismiss immediatelyand then use as an excuse to resent youeven more, what's your point?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:21"><subtitle>
My point is, you're stunted from havinghealthy relationships with horses, idiot!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:26"><subtitle>
Oh, really? Well, if that were true,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:27"><subtitle>
I would have almostno other horses in my life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:30"><subtitle>
Right, it's almost as if all your friendsand loved onesare humans or dogs or cats--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:35"><subtitle>
But then how do you explainthe one horse I do care about,my half-sister Hollyhock,who is also a reminder of my father?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:40"><subtitle>
If your theory were true,wouldn't I keep her at arms' length,desperate for her to love mebut unwilling to be vulnerable enoughto allow her to hurt me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:46"><subtitle>
You blockhead, she's not your father!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:49"><subtitle>
Hollyhock reminds youof the horse you hate the most. Yourself!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:53"><subtitle>
Okay, you got me!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:54"><subtitle>
My parents gave me an internalizedself-hatred of horses.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:57"><subtitle>
So, my horse body is a prisonthat I can never escape.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:00"><subtitle>
This manifests in rotten behaviorbecause I subconsciously believeI deserve to be punished,but being famous, I'm never punished,so I act out even more.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:07"><subtitle>
And since this patternis so woven into my identity,it is unfathomable to me that it canever be curbed, so instead, I drink!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:14"><subtitle>
Uh... Check, please!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:16"><subtitle>
So, the only way I can progressis to return to my life as a sober manand finally hold myself accountablefor my actions, past and future.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:22"><subtitle>
Oh, my God, is this what therapy is?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:24"><subtitle>
Why do you keep bringing me checks?</subtitle>
