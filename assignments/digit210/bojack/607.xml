</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:33"><subtitle>
Seems unimportant in lightof what you've been dealing with.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:35"><subtitle>
What I'm dealing with?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:36"><subtitle>
Your psychiatrist said you're depressed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:38"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:42"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:03:55"><subtitle>
I'd feel better if you just triedthe medication your doctor prescribed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:59"><subtitle>
Well, I'd feel worse.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:00"><subtitle>
They put me on Prozac in collegeand I was so calm and boring,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:04"><subtitle>
I didn't even wanna LiveJournal.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:05"><subtitle>
And then Dawson's Creek got bad becausethere was no one to speak truth to power.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:09"><subtitle>
Dawson's Creek did not get bad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:11"><subtitle>
You just started taking antidepressants,which you should also do now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:14"><subtitle>
It sucks. It made me break out.I gained weight.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:16"><subtitle>
What if you leave and come backto this person you don't even recognize?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:20"><subtitle>
I don't even recognize you now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:23"><subtitle>
You're making this a bigger thingthan it is. I'll be fine.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:27"><subtitle>
Don't fall for one of those models.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:29"><subtitle>
I'm a one-woman man.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:31"><subtitle>
If that woman happensto be a turtle in a two-piece,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:33"><subtitle>

<description>knocks on door</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:38"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description> You're the most beautiful personin the world to me. You know that, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:42"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:04:45"><subtitle>
<description>groans</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:49"><subtitle>
These strike negotiationshave lasted so long,it's like Reds in this boardroom.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:53"><subtitle>
Remember Reds? Two VHS tapes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:55"><subtitle>
That's too many tapes, I said,but no one listens to Lenny.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:59"><subtitle>
How's this look?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:00"><subtitle>
Generous, but you're making upthe projected lossby excising office birthday cakes.That's unacceptable.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:05"><subtitle>
Everybody hates office parties.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:07"><subtitle>
Everyone hates the mysteriousdried fruit cubes in trail mixbut we still eat them after the other nutsand seeds are gonebecause in our undervalued,overworked existence,we're desperatefor any morsel of satisfaction,whether that be cake,unidentifiable orange fruit shardsor the occasional kind word from our boss.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:21"><subtitle>
I like cake.They can print those pictures on them now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:23"><subtitle>
What's the issue here?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:24"><subtitle>
Fine. But we're grouping birthdaysso they only happen once a month.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:28"><subtitle>
We accept those terms.We're left with one final issue.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:31"><subtitle>
Your insistence assistantsbe not treated like garbage?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:34"><subtitle>
From this day forth, all assistantswill be treated like recycling.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:38"><subtitle>
Right next to the garbage,but with an understanding that one day,they may be up-cycled to a higher status.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:44"><subtitle>
Like a bunch of seatbeltsthat got turned into a purse.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:47"><subtitle>
Or a license plate that gets turnedinto a purse. Right, Lenny?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:50"><subtitle>
Sure, sure. I'm green.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:52"><subtitle>
-We're amenable to these terms.-Oh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:58"><subtitle>
-Judah. I meant to reach out---There's no need to explain,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:01"><subtitle>
I know you're very busywith work and Ruthie.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:03"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description> You have no idea.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:05"><subtitle>
I have some idea.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:06"><subtitle>
You talked about it quite oftenduring the negotiations.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:08"><subtitle>
This strike has been the most time I'vebeen able to spend with Ruthie since...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:12"><subtitle>
-<description>coos</description>-...ever.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:14"><subtitle>
I also feel an ambivalenceabout the strike ending.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:16"><subtitle>
The negotiations have beenquite invigorating.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:18"><subtitle>
And now you're just gonna ride offinto the sunset?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:21"><subtitle>
No, the sun sets in the west.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:23"><subtitle>
I'm riding east to my Atwater cottage.<description>grunts</description> Goodbye.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:26"><subtitle>
-Judah!-Yes?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:27"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:06:44"><subtitle>
Mm.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:50"><subtitle>
Thank you for meeting me here.I can't be at my house.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:53"><subtitle>
Just reminds meof what an asshole I've been.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:55"><subtitle>
Makes sense. Your house reminds meof what an asshole you've been, too.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:58"><subtitle>
-<description>camera shutter clicking</description>-Uh... what are you doing?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:59"><subtitle>
I'm updating my asexual dating profilewith some fresh pics.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:03"><subtitle>
There's still no one else on the app,but when they join, I wanna be ready.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:07"><subtitle>
Look at this busted photo.It's from over a year ago.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:13"><subtitle>
Yeah, you gotta stay current.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:14"><subtitle>
Oh, man, they always ask for your job.Oh, I actually have a job!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:17"><subtitle>
Hype man for babies.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:19"><subtitle>
You've really taken to thisnanny thing, huh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:21"><subtitle>
I love it. It's so amazingto hold a baby and look at it sleepand think, "This is a perfect thing."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:27"><subtitle>
-I can't imagine.-It's weird to think that at one point,someone held me in their handsand thought,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:33"><subtitle>
"I'm going to love this kid forever,"you know? What happened?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:37"><subtitle>
What happened to what?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:38"><subtitle>
I don't know. Moms are weird, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:40"><subtitle>
Um... Yeah, moms are weird.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:43"><subtitle>
So, what are you gonna do now?Just keep getting lunch with your friends?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:47"><subtitle>
There was a stewardess in the meeting.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:48"><subtitle>
She was talking about how every day,she wakes up in a different place.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:52"><subtitle>
I thought, "That sounds perfect."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:54"><subtitle>
Every city a clean slate?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:56"><subtitle>
Stewardess?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:57"><subtitle>
I think the preferred termis flight servant.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:01"><subtitle>
<description>soft music playing</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:17"><subtitle>
To us! And depression!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:18"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description> Yes, but before I drink to thatand then depart with youon a cross-country tourof speaking engagementsas the quote-unquote "Face of Depression,"there is something I feelI must get off my chest.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:29"><subtitle>
As it says on the cover of my last single"You Can Tell Me Anything,"you can tell me anything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:33"><subtitle>
-I am not depressed.-<description>gasps</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:37"><subtitle>
Wait. How can you know that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:38"><subtitle>
Well, I feel very happy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:40"><subtitle>
Oh, I know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:42"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description> Just as I suspected, half-full!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:44"><subtitle>
Hmm. That is a troubling development.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:46"><subtitle>
And right before our tour!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:48"><subtitle>
I would be quite upset by thisif I were at all prone to depression,which, as we've just established,I am not.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:53"><subtitle>
But isn't it possible thatyou are depressed and just don't know it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:56"><subtitle>
Well, I do frequently not know things.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:59"><subtitle>
According to the literature for this tourthat I did not readbut had my mom peruseand then paraphrase for me,people who seem happy can actuallybe the most depressed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:08"><subtitle>
Oh, no! I seem very happy!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:09"><subtitle>
-I know.-But wait! You seem happy, too!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:12"><subtitle>
Oh, no, does that mean I'm also depressed?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:14"><subtitle>
-Oh, good thing we're going on this tour.-We gotta get the word out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:19"><subtitle>
-A cinnabunny and a coffee, please.-3.25.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:24"><subtitle>
Four and five.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:25"><subtitle>
As Gandhi says, "Make the change you wishto see in the world."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:27"><subtitle>
Goodbye, change. Good luck out there.I'll miss you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:30"><subtitle>
-Uh, what?-It's for the best. Go.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:32"><subtitle>
Just go, please.Don't make it harder than it has to be.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:35"><subtitle>
Okay.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:14"><subtitle>
-Uh, is this a bad time or...?-No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:17"><subtitle>
It's just...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:19"><subtitle>
Heat's broken. Let's go for a walk.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:24"><subtitle>
-Why didn't you tell me you were coming?-I didn't know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:26"><subtitle>
I was in LA and I didn't want to be, so...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:30"><subtitle>
-I'm glad you're here.-You doing okay?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:32"><subtitle>
I'm doing great.I have this wonderful boyfriend.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:35"><subtitle>
I got an advanceon a book of personal essays.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:38"><subtitle>
Me, personal essays.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:39"><subtitle>
I mean, who am I? Sloane Crosley?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:41"><subtitle>
-Who's Sloane Crosley?-Good point. Who's Sloane Crosley?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:44"><subtitle>
Yeah, who is Sloane Crosley?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:46"><subtitle>
Exactly.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:48"><subtitle>
But the headline is you're doing great?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:50"><subtitle>
So great.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:51"><subtitle>
<description>slurps</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:54"><subtitle>
-Can I crash at your apartment?-No!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:00"><subtitle>
-I think I'm depressed.-Yeah?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:02"><subtitle>
It started when I was having troublewith my book,and then it kind of snowballedinto my boyfriend sayingI should take antidepressants.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:10"><subtitle>
-Are you going to?-What's the point?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:12"><subtitle>
Of antidepressants? I believe the pointis to be antidepressed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:15"><subtitle>
Sure. Or you just flip over the nothingand underneath there's more nothing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:22"><subtitle>
Then you flip over that nothingand there's more nothing underneath that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:26"><subtitle>
So, you just keep flipping over nothings,all your life,because you keep thinkingunder all that nothing,there's gotta be something,but all you find is nothing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:36"><subtitle>
Sure, but you flip over this pizza box,uh, and look, a couch!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:40"><subtitle>
We're gonna break up soon anyway.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:41"><subtitle>
There's only so long before he gets tiredof the real me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:44"><subtitle>
The real you being...?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:45"><subtitle>
Ta-da!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:47"><subtitle>
You know, someone got really madat me recently...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:50"><subtitle>
Mad? At you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:52"><subtitle>
I know, shocking.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:53"><subtitle>
And he said, "BoJack, you ruin everything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:55"><subtitle>
-That's what you are."-Oof.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:57"><subtitle>
And it actually took him saying itout loudfor me to realize how stupid that is,even though I believed it for so long.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:05"><subtitle>
I bought into this idea that I was a thingthat couldn't be changed.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:13:08"><subtitle>
Hollyhock and I are in a fight right now.It's both minute and massive.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:12"><subtitle>
How can it be minute and massive?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:14"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:44"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:50"><subtitle>
So, yeah, now Tawnie's gottachange her major,which I get why that sucks,but don't take it out on me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:57"><subtitle>
