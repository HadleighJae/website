A hummingbird smiled at meon my walk this morning.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:15"><subtitle>
In small pleasures such as this,I'm reminded of the presence of the Lord.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:19"><subtitle>
-As you ought.-And yet...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:22"><subtitle>
-No.-Out with it, Sister Marguerite.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:24"><subtitle>
To hesitate is to waste time,which is a sin when timecould be elsewise spent in prayer,or handwashing Monsignor Toscani's1962 Alfa Romeo,which is itself a form of prayer,is it not?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:36"><subtitle>
Of course. Yet I find myself consumedby thoughts of my past.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:41"><subtitle>
You have no past. You've confessed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:43"><subtitle>
Your sins have been washed clean.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:45"><subtitle>
This is like day one stuff,what are we talking about here?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:48"><subtitle>
The people I've hurt,the lives I've ruined,are they washed clean as well?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:55"><subtitle>
Your regrets are of no benefitto the Lord.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:57"><subtitle>
Ruminating so is a solipsism unbefittinga sister of the cloth.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:01"><subtitle>
Is it solipsism to be concernedwith the fates of others?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:05"><subtitle>
Perhaps one could arguecloistering oneself from the worldis itself a form of solipsism.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:01:10"><subtitle>
<description>stammers</description> If one were being ungenerous.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:12"><subtitle>
Remember when you first arrived hereand you didn't talk for like two years?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:17"><subtitle>
I will trouble you no further, Mother.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:19"><subtitle>

Are assistants treated better or havethings reverted to business as usual?</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:42"><subtitle>
She's the best reporterthis building's ever seen,but, goddamn,is that woman a pain in the ass.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:46"><subtitle>
<description>Paige</description> Colleagues!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:48"><subtitle>
Your eyes do not deceive!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:49"><subtitle>
You may find my gown overly formalfor the workplace,but that is because I am, as of todayformerly a memberof this vaulted institution.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:55"><subtitle>
As I'm to be wed tonightand the newsroom is no roomfor a domesticated woman,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:59"><subtitle>
-I bid you farewell.-<description>man screams</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:01"><subtitle>
Okay, goodbye.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:02"><subtitle>
Yes, mine was a storied runas the star reporter for "The Reporter."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:05"><subtitle>
"Front Page Paige," they called me!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:07"><subtitle>
-Well, we'll miss you, Paige.-Indeed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:09"><subtitle>
My shoes don't fill easy,my left foot striking a more robustsilhouette than her starboard sister.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:13"><subtitle>
But I cannot prolong my engagement.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:15"><subtitle>
After all, time, as they say,is a river without banks.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:18"><subtitle>
Time may not have banks,but this periodical certainly does.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:03:25"><subtitle>
I may lack your nose for news,but I've got an eyeball for a highball!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:29"><subtitle>
Why, this man couldn'tstring together two clauses</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:31"><subtitle>
without ending on a preposition.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:33"><subtitle>
I don't know what you're referring to.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:34"><subtitle>
You could fill a librarywith all the things you don't know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:36"><subtitle>
In fact, they do.They call them libraries.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:40"><subtitle>
Guys, we're trying to work here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:41"><subtitle>
No matter, I shan't be staying.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:43"><subtitle>
My sweet betrothed, Baxter Bellamy,awaits with champagneto chauffeur me directly to my nuptials,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:47"><subtitle>
and I didn't think I'd visit long,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:48"><subtitle>
so I left him in the carwith the windows up. <description>chuckles</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:51"><subtitle>
Good, I've got businessto attend to as well.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:53"><subtitle>
I'll have you know it's almost timefor my mid-morning confabulation</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:57"><subtitle>
with a former stage mother to the stars,Mrs. Carol Himmelfarb-Richardson.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:01"><subtitle>
You've been taking those phone calls?!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:03"><subtitle>
Yes, she is as loony as a Canadian dollar,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:06"><subtitle>
but she is a scintillatingconversationalist.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:09"><subtitle>
Oh? What about the conversationscintillates?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:12"><subtitle>
She calls every day to see if we haveany information on her dead daughter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:15"><subtitle>
-The answer's always no.-Sounds like a scoop.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:17"><subtitle>
It's not. It's a pop star who overdosed.Open-and-shut case.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:20"><subtitle>
-All the better for opening and shutting.-Why do you have that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:23"><subtitle>
Baxter, my boy,my dear sweet beautiful bridegroom,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:27"><subtitle>
best put the champagne on ice.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:28"><subtitle>
I've got a story that simply demandsmy attentionand I just couldn't marry youbefore it's settled.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:32"><subtitle>
I'd only be distracted,which isn't fair to you or me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:35"><subtitle>
Oh, darling, I've already committedto being your wife.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:38"><subtitle>
What, you need to hear a few measly words?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:40"><subtitle>
Well, "I do." Does that satisfy?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:41"><subtitle>
I do, I do, I do,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:43"><subtitle>
and I do want youto wait for me to ring you again shortly.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:46"><subtitle>
<description>snorts</description> I knew you'd understand.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:49"><subtitle>
Oh. Mm! <description>snorts</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:51"><subtitle>
Now, as to the girl.I smell beans. Spill 'em.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:54"><subtitle>
The girl's name was Sharon Lynn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:57"><subtitle>
It's Sarah Lynn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:59"><subtitle>
Hmm...</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:05:01"><subtitle>
<music> Don't you touch my prickly muffin </music></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:06"><subtitle>
Did you ever notice that this music videotakes place in a planetarium,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:10"><subtitle>
-and Sarah Lynn died in a planetarium?-Huh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:13"><subtitle>
-Uh... Hey, Tawnie.-<description>music stops</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:15"><subtitle>
Are we going to this party?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:16"><subtitle>
I didn't come all the way downto Manhattanto just watch you watch your boyfriendbe on the internetat his parents' fancy house.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:22"><subtitle>
Don't parent-shame him, Hollyhock.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:24"><subtitle>
It's not Trey's fault he grew upin an Upper Westside brownstone.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:27"><subtitle>
Also, I'm not her boyfriend.We're uncomplicated like that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:31"><subtitle>
Come on! We're missing the party.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:33"><subtitle>
What? No. If we show up before 2:00,everyone's gonna think we're losers.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:37"><subtitle>
Fine. But can't we do something elsewhile we wait? <description>gasps</description></subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:52"><subtitle>
Apparently, there's a bar around herecalled Hartigan's.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:55"><subtitle>
My cousin and his friends call it"They-Don't-Cardigan's." I don't get it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:59"><subtitle>
Wow, a real New York bar.That could be cool.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:02"><subtitle>
Yeah, a bar! But how often are wein New York?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:07"><subtitle>
Let's go to the topof the Empire State Building,like the big apein that movie, Sleepless in Seattle!</subtitle>

Lord, we thank You for this bounty-- Ella?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:22"><subtitle>
That place you sent me didn't fix me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:24"><subtitle>
Because I am not a thing to be fixed,Daddy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:27"><subtitle>
Have a seat. We're havin' bacon-blastedchicken fingers from Chicken-4-Dayz.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:31"><subtitle>
I'm not staying. I'm going to a placewhere the people accept me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:35"><subtitle>
You sit your ass in that chair, Ella,because that place is right here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:39"><subtitle>
Oh, Daddy!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:41"><subtitle>
That's what I wish I'd said.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:42"><subtitle>
I haven't seen Ella in four years,but every night I bring home dinner,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:46"><subtitle>
I get an extra bucket of bacon-blastedchicken fingers just for her,so that if she ever comes home...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:50"><subtitle>
she'll know that she's welcomeat our table.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:53"><subtitle>
Huh?</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:06:54"><subtitle>
Kelsey Jannings,our little indie film darling,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:58"><subtitle>
I think I speak for both of uswhen I say gooba, gooba, hey, yah, yah!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:02"><subtitle>
Tears. Feel my cheeks.Damp cheeks over here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:05"><subtitle>
I do notice it's notas Chicken-4-Dayz-focusedas maybe it seemed in the outline stage?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:10"><subtitle>
Talk us through your journey there.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:11"><subtitle>
What do you want?You want a close-up of the bucket?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:14"><subtitle>
Ooh, I think that would make itfeel like a commercial,and what's so innovativeabout this contentis that it's not a commercial.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:20"><subtitle>
Right, I forgot about the innovative partof it. Excuse me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:23"><subtitle>
Our target demo responds poorlywhen they feelthey're being advertised to,but they love stories that engage themon their level,utilizing themes of inclusivity,as well as dunking on the olds.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:34"><subtitle>
Ah, yes, teens love dunking on olds,is there any way to get more of that in?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:39"><subtitle>
-Well, we already shot the ad.-Not an ad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:41"><subtitle>
The immersive product placement journey.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:43"><subtitle>
But maybe I can find takesthat are in more of a dunking tone,as well as shotsthat highlight more prominentlybut do not feature the bucketof chicken-bacon finger-blasters.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:52"><subtitle>
Thank you for letting us help you shareyour beautiful vision with the world.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

And Vassar doesn't accept indie credin lieu of my daughter's tuition.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:07"><subtitle>
I just don't believe it.You're a way better director than I am.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:10"><subtitle>
If you'd told me that one dayyou'd be doing chicken commercials--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:14"><subtitle>
-Not a commercial.-That you'd be doingsponsored content pre-rollfor Beverly Hillbillies reruns on Gronklewhile I'm directing anotheraction-adventure blockbuster,this one set in the worldof competitive ballroom dancing,working title, "Balls to the Wall,"if you'd told me that...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:29"><subtitle>
You'd be super-stoked?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:30"><subtitle>
Yeah, first, I'd be really stoked,but then eventually,I would get around to being outraged.</subtitle>

-Right?-Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:42"><subtitle>
-<description>cell phone buzzing</description>-Sorry.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:47"><subtitle>
Again? Okay.</subtitle>

-Yeah. I'll talk to her.-<description>phone beeps</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:51"><subtitle>
What are these new pages?Why do I have new pages?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:54"><subtitle>
You don't like the new pages?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:55"><subtitle>
<description>groans</description> The content of the pagesis not the issue, Justin.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:58"><subtitle>
-Yeah.-I spent time preparing the other pages.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:00"><subtitle>
You understand?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:01"><subtitle>
I rehearsed them. I studied them.That's precious time I'll never get back!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:04"><subtitle>
And then some person--I don't know this person--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:07"><subtitle>
And by the way, I don't like strangepersons knocking on my doorand then letting themselves in.The knock is so I can tell you to enter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:13"><subtitle>
If you just enter,what is the purpose of the knock?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:15"><subtitle>
You're right, of course.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:16"><subtitle>
My point is about the pages.Why are you throwing new things at me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:20"><subtitle>
The insurance guys are nixingthe car chase.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:22"><subtitle>
We had to think fast, so we put togethera new hand-to-hand combat scenewe're gonna throw on topof the meringue number.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:27"><subtitle>
-So, it's a stunt?-I thought you'd be excited.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:29"><subtitle>
I'm excited!It's more time spent on your face.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:33"><subtitle>
Ever since I directed you in that episodeof "FBI: Female Body Inspectors,"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:36"><subtitle>
I thought... <description>chuckles</description>"I gotta give this woman her close-up."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:39"><subtitle>
Don't produce me, Justin.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:41"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description> Is there choreography?When am I learning this stunt?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:43"><subtitle>
April's gonna be on set.She'll make sure you understand the stunt.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:47"><subtitle>
-And it's gonna be safe?-We are taking every precaution.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:49"><subtitle>
And we are not gonna shootuntil you are 100 percent comfortable.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:53"><subtitle>
Thank you.I didn't mean to bite your head off.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:55"><subtitle>
-I just don't like being surprised, okay?-Totally my fault.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:57"><subtitle>
I should've warned you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:59"><subtitle>
Is there something else going onthat I should know about?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:03"><subtitle>
I'm fine. I'm actually beingreally cool here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:05"><subtitle>
I'm not some kind of monsterjust because I don't like surprises.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:08"><subtitle>
I'm number one on the call sheet.I'm entitled to a little respect.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:10"><subtitle>
No, you're right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:11"><subtitle>
I mean, I've worked on projectswhere the number one on the call sheetwas like an actual crazy person,so I think I'm being really cool.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:17"><subtitle>
-You are being so cool.-Yeah?</subtitle>
</timestamp>

<timestamp time="00:10:36"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description> Kelsey! You can'tcompare yourself to Justin Kenyon.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:40"><subtitle>
-What's the difference?-The difference is he has a great agent.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:44"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description> That was a joke,but I see you're in no mood.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:46"><subtitle>
I'm a good director.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:48"><subtitle>
Yes, but Justin's moviesmake actual money.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:50"><subtitle>
The last big movie you were on,you got fired off of.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:53"><subtitle>
Explain this to me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:55"><subtitle>
I didn't breakinto the Nixon Library aloneand yet I'm the only onewhose career has suffered.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:00"><subtitle>
Why do you think that is?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:01"><subtitle>
Kelse, I don't know by what fancythe fates push us aboutin their great cosmic dance.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:07"><subtitle>
-I am but an agent.-What about these stories I keep hearingabout how people wanna hiremore female directors?</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:17"><subtitle>
Which particular project?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:18"><subtitle>
Anyone. I mean, you name it.Whatever Paul Feig's doing.</subtitle>

<description>Sarah Lynn</description> Hey, Mommy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:51"><subtitle>
I got out of a meetingand we're making amends,so I just wanted to say I'm sorryI'm such a disappointment. <description>chuckles</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:59"><subtitle>
I'm sorry my platinum records clashedwith the chic minimalismof your new sun room.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:05"><subtitle>
And I'm sorry I didn't introduce youas my older sisterwhen we met David Hasselhoffat the Kids' Choice Awards.</subtitle>

And I'm sorry I've never beenenough for you, Mommy!</subtitle>

What? I'm the one who keeps saying,"Let's go to the party."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:40"><subtitle>
The only reason I came down here was sowe could go to this party and get drunk.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:44"><subtitle>
Come on. I've gone to likea hundred parties with you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:47"><subtitle>
You always say you're gonna drink,and you never do, which is fine,by the way!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:52"><subtitle>
No one's ever offered me a drink.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:54"><subtitle>
I keep waitingfor this famous peer pressure</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:56"><subtitle>
I've heard so much aboutand it never happens!</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:13:06"><subtitle>
I'm nervous about losing control,you know?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:10"><subtitle>
I think drinking alcoholmight not be for you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:13"><subtitle>
But I don't wanna be scared of somethingthat's supposed to be fun.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:16"><subtitle>
That's why I wanna go to that partywith a bunch of strangers.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:20"><subtitle>
Because if I'm gonna lose control, I don'twant it to be in front of people I know.</subtitle>

Am I speakingto the future director of "Fireflame"?!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:45"><subtitle>
-What's that?-"Fireflame"! It's a superhero movie!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:49"><subtitle>
Ugh. Another one?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:50"><subtitle>
Yes, but the difference is this one'sabout a lady superhero,which means this one you couldactually get hired on!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:57"><subtitle>
I don't want them to hire mejust because I'm a woman.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:59"><subtitle>
Ugh. You think Justin Kenyon says,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:01"><subtitle>
"I don't want them to hire mejust because I'm a man"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:04"><subtitle>
Of course not! He says, "Money,money, money. Nom, nom, nom."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:06"><subtitle>
I have heard him say that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:08"><subtitle>
Besides, they don't want thisto be just another superhero movie.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:11"><subtitle>
They're looking for someone who can makea superhero movie with a twist!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:15"><subtitle>
So, what, they want me to pitch the twist?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:17"><subtitle>
-No, the twist is that it's a woman.-Oh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:20"><subtitle>
But they do wanna hear your take,by which I mean they want you,as a woman, to tell them their take.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:26"><subtitle>
Hmm...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:28"><subtitle>
<description>man</description> I've been saying for yearsas soon as we run outof popular male charactersand we've given them each two sequels,we have to make a movie about Fireflame!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:36"><subtitle>
I think that's really edgyand outside the box.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:38"><subtitle>
Outside is exactly where we're tryingto be, in relation to the box.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:41"><subtitle>
We really think Fireflame can connectwith today's Yas Queen culture.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:45"><subtitle>
Yeah, I got a real Yas Queen vibefrom her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:48"><subtitle>
She comes in, she saves the day,everyone loves her!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:51"><subtitle>
-Wow.-Oh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:52"><subtitle>
Didn't I tell you this would makea great movie?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:54"><subtitle>
Uh, pretty sure I told you, Nancy.I have always loved Fireflame.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:58"><subtitle>
I'm sorry. I remember now,you did tell me that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:01"><subtitle>
Well, uh, thanks for coming in.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:03"><subtitle>

If Sarah Lynn was going to meetings here,someone must have seen her,and if someone saw something,then I wanna know it,particularly as it pertains--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:34"><subtitle>
What crime have I committedto deserve so long a sentence?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:37"><subtitle>
I've got a point.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:38"><subtitle>
Once you arrived at it,send me a postcard.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:40"><subtitle>
The starlet was alonewhen she died, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:42"><subtitle>
But there was someone elsewith her while she was blotto.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:44"><subtitle>
Who was that person? What'd they see?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:47"><subtitle>
And why weren't they mentionedin the police report?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:49"><subtitle>
There's your who, what and why.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:50"><subtitle>
Get a when and a where in there,and we've got ourselves a story.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:53"><subtitle>
Bully for you, you're almost caught upto where I was an hour ago.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:56"><subtitle>
Let's chat again in an hourwhen you've gotten to where I'm at now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:58"><subtitle>
Sounds good.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:59"><subtitle>
In the meantime, someone in this buildingmight just offer the keythat opens the gate to the gardenwith the tree that bears the fruitthat is our scoop.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:06"><subtitle>
Get someone to squeal on an AA meeting?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:07"><subtitle>
I do believe one "A"of the two stands for "anonymous."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:11"><subtitle>
The other "A",I could not possibly fathom.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:13"><subtitle>
I envy your faith in the honorand discretion of other people.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:16"><subtitle>
Let's see how that honor stacks upagainst the desireto dish on celebritiesso as to appear swank by association.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:22"><subtitle>
Excuse me, kind stranger.I'm writing a story</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:25"><subtitle>
-on the efficacy of your program.-Uh-huh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:27"><subtitle>
I understand one of the pillarsis anonymity, but if you could...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:30"><subtitle>
I once saw Craig Ferguson here!I don't know why I said that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:32"><subtitle>
<description>gasps</description> Oh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:34"><subtitle>
I really shouldn't say. It's anonymous,but I have seen Robert Downey, Jr.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:38"><subtitle>
Jamie Lee Curtis winked at me once.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:41"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:45"><subtitle>
-Sarah Lynn, I've seen.-Really?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:47"><subtitle>
About a month before she died.It was pretty clear she was using.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:50"><subtitle>
Well, how do you figure?Did she say something?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:52"><subtitle>
She didn't, but her friend did.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:55"><subtitle>
-Her friend?-Large fella.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:56"><subtitle>
I think he was a horseor a bull maybe, it's hard to remember.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:00"><subtitle>
Kind of like a rounder Brad Garrett type,but with a very forgettable face.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:04"><subtitle>
He told a story, though, I remember that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:06"><subtitle>
It was about a trip he took to...New Mexico.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:10"><subtitle>
-Oh?-Yeah, it was about a girl and a mother.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:13"><subtitle>
Oh, this is so long ago now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:15"><subtitle>
I think he had sex with the girl,or maybe he had sex with the mother?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:19"><subtitle>
Well, do get your story sorted,but I'd prefer it if it's sordid.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:23"><subtitle>
And this man left with Sarah Lynn?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:25"><subtitle>
Do you recall anything elseabout this man, his name, perhaps?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:28"><subtitle>
No, but I remember the girl's name.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:30"><subtitle>
Yes, Sarah Lynn,now we're all up to speed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:33"><subtitle>
No, the girl from his story.The one in New Mexico.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:37"><subtitle>
He was weirdly proud of it,said her name was Penny Carson.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:41"><subtitle>
Carson, eh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:43"><subtitle>
"Penny Carson," he said. "And that'sher real name, you can look her up!"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:47"><subtitle>
I remember thinking,"Why does he want us to look her up?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:52"><subtitle>
<description>both</description> Hmm.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:55"><subtitle>
So she's sexy,but don't you call her sweetheart.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:59"><subtitle>
-<description>laughs</description> Boy.-Oh, that is so Fireflame.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:02"><subtitle>
-<description>yelps</description>-Oh, wow!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:03"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:18:04"><subtitle>
-I'm sorry, I can't let you---Uh, excuse me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:07"><subtitle>
Are you already-- Sorry.I'm sure she's got a great pitch,but the movie you want,it's just not realistic.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:11"><subtitle>
Sure it is.Wendy Wiggum ate fire as a babyand now she holds the powerof the Fireflame. It's all very logical.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:17"><subtitle>
No, I just mean you're doing thisall wrong.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:19"><subtitle>
She saves the day,and everybody loves her?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:22"><subtitle>
I mean, yeah, that makes senseif she's a man.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:24"><subtitle>
But it's never worked like that for me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:25"><subtitle>
Well, this isn't about you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:27"><subtitle>
That's right! It's about an exotic dancerwho's also interdimensional.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:31"><subtitle>
No. I mean the rules are differentfor women.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:33"><subtitle>
If you're a womanand you save the day, nobody loves you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:36"><subtitle>
People take you for granted,or worse, they resent you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:39"><subtitle>
They punish you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:40"><subtitle>
The more powerful you are,the more they'll take your power away.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:43"><subtitle>
And I just think if your movie is smart,you'll acknowledge that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:46"><subtitle>
-Ooh, yeah, sounds like a bummer.-Yeah, it's a bummer.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:49"><subtitle>
Being a superhero is hard.Otherwise, everyone would do it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:52"><subtitle>
Okay, well, thank you for--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:53"><subtitle>
Maybe that is a bad superhero movie.Not aspirational enough, I don't know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:57"><subtitle>
But it's real. And it's different.</subtitle>
