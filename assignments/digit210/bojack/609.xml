<timestamp time="00:02:38"><subtitle>
-<description>all</description> Ooh!-Oh! Okay. You.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:41"><subtitle>
According to Stanislothski,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:42"><subtitle>
acting is the desireto create inside of oneself</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:45"><subtitle>
another, deeper, more interesting life</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:47"><subtitle>
than the onethat actually surrounds him...or her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:50"><subtitle>
-Oh, okay, yes, but also... Yes?-<description>girl</description> Oh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:53"><subtitle>
Meisner would say, "Acting is behavingtruthfully under imaginary circumstances."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:57"><subtitle>
Acting is behaving truthfullyunder imaginary circumstances.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:03:00"><subtitle>
Uh, okay, wow. So, that's acting.But what is--?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:03"><subtitle>
Guys, I'm concerned this classis getting very theory-qua-theory...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:06"><subtitle>I was about to say that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:08"><subtitle>
...when technique should be a meanstoward a more engaging art.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:11"><subtitle>
-Well, quite astute.-Sorry, horse professor. What's acting?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:14"><subtitle>
Um...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:15"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:18"><subtitle>
Acting is...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:20"><subtitle>
Uh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:22"><subtitle>
I don't know what acting is.I don't know what I'm doing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:26"><subtitle>
I shouldn't be here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:27"><subtitle>
-<description>boy</description> Wow.-<description>girl</description> Oh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:29"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:34"><subtitle>
Class dismissed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:36"><subtitle>
But we still havean hour and 20 minutes left.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:38"><subtitle>
Yes. Again, I was acting.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:40"><subtitle>
You sounded serious.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:42"><subtitle>
Instead of judging my acting,how about you act and I judge you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:45"><subtitle>
-For real?-Yeah. Good point.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:46"><subtitle>
We could show you the sceneswe were working on last semester.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:49"><subtitle>
Uh, sure.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:51"><subtitle>
-This is from "Kablammo, Mother."-Whenever you're ready.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:55"><subtitle>
Mama, where's Daddy's old World War IIgrenade with the pin still in it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:59"><subtitle>
<description>in British accent</description> Why would you wantan old thing like that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:02"><subtitle>
Tonight, I intend to explode myself.Where are the extra towels?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:07"><subtitle>
-Okay, okay. Stop, stop.-What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:09"><subtitle>
-Does this play take place in England?-<description>normal voice</description> No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:11"><subtitle>
So why are you talkingwith an English accent?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:14"><subtitle>
I'm acting.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:15"><subtitle>
Just as an exercise,maybe use your normal voice.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:18"><subtitle>
And Tawnie, when you're tellingyour mother you're gonna kill yourself,the next line is,"Where are the extra towels," right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:24"><subtitle>
And the character's being very casual,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:26"><subtitle>
so maybe she should also be casualwhen she says she's gonna kill herself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:29"><subtitle>
Like it's a big deal,but it's not a big deal for her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:31"><subtitle>
-Like that's the irony of the scene.-Whoa! That's really smart.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:35"><subtitle>
Yeah. Yeah, it is.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:38"><subtitle>
Okay, let's see it again.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:46"><subtitle>
<description>raspy voice</description> I detest Scattergories!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:48"><subtitle>
Whatever the prompt,you always answer in vague allusionsto the baby we never had!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:53"><subtitle>
Stop. You're both talking to the audience.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:55"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:59"><subtitle>

-Hubba hubba, I'm horny for leads!-Okay, here's my question for you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:12"><subtitle>
Does your characterknow he's horny for leads,or is he discovering it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:17"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:54"><subtitle>
Or rental car cashier class? I don't know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:56"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:00"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:01"><subtitle>
You said "Not a good actor."But now that you've said it...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:05"><subtitle>
Some would say there are no bad actors,only bad teachers.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:08"><subtitle>
What about Jason Segel?He was a bad actor in Bad Teacher.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:11"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:14"><subtitle>
-Well, do you understand this rugby thing?-Uh, honestly? No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:18"><subtitle>
She came back from winter breaksuper aggro, but that's Hollyhock, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:21"><subtitle>
Suddenly, she decides,"This is what I'm all about now,and everyone elsejust has to get on board."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:25"><subtitle>

You'll marry me, and the two of youwill never see each other again.</subtitle>
