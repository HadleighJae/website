</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:15"><subtitle>
I understand you're trying to be helpful,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:17"><subtitle>
-in your own pushy, self-absorbed way.-Oh, thank you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:19"><subtitle>
But I don't wanna writea middle-grade fiction detective series.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:22"><subtitle>
I think you do, though.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:24"><subtitle>
Because when I was reading it,I could tell you were having fun.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:28"><subtitle>
Yeah, but I'm not writing a bookto have fun.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:30"><subtitle>
If I don't write my book of essays now,I never will!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:33"><subtitle>
So? Don't write your book of essays.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:34"><subtitle>
-I have to!-Why?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:36"><subtitle>
Because if I don't,that means that all the damage I gotisn't good damage, it's just damage.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:43"><subtitle>
I have gotten nothing out of it,and all those yearsI was miserable was for nothing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:48"><subtitle>
I could have been happy this whole timeand written books about girl detectivesand been cheerful and popularand had good parents,is that what you're saying?What was it all for?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:57"><subtitle>
I...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:58"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:00"><subtitle>
I don't know, Diane.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:01"><subtitle>
All I know is that this bookabout the girl detective is fun.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:06"><subtitle>
I liked it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:07"><subtitle>
I like thinking that my daughtercould grow up in a worldwith books like that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:11"><subtitle>
Or if my daughter's not a reader,a lucrative film adaptation.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:14"><subtitle>
When I was a little girl,I thought that everything,all the abuse and neglect,it somehow made me special,and I decided that one dayI would write somethingthat would make little girls like mefeel less alone.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:27"><subtitle>
And if I can't write that book...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:30"><subtitle>
Then...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:32"><subtitle>
Then maybe write this other book.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:24:35"><subtitle>
-Maybe this book does that, too.-Yeah?</subtitle>
