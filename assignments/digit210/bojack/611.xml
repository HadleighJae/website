</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:14"><subtitle>

<description>students cheering</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:23"><subtitle>
You think he passed outfrom embarrassment?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:25"><subtitle>
-Because the kids are not talented.-What happened?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:28"><subtitle>
He was getting off a phone call.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:29"><subtitle>
I had some constructive criticismabout his play.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:32"><subtitle>
I tried a compliment sandwichby starting with some praise,but he passed out!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:37"><subtitle>
Just goes to show,you never know how much time you havewith someone,so you should always saythe bad stuff first.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:43"><subtitle>
-<description>gasping</description>-BoJack! Your play sucked!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:46"><subtitle>
They found out. I didn't--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:47"><subtitle>
-It's not true.-What's not true?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:49"><subtitle>
I need to-- Air.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:50"><subtitle>
<description>students singing</description><music> For he's our trusty director </music></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:53"><subtitle>
No. They can't know.I didn't even do anything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:55"><subtitle>
-It's---Slow down.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:56"><subtitle>
Why don't you tell us what happened?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:58"><subtitle>
Okay, I'll tell you.But you can't talk to anyone.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:02"><subtitle>
No reporters.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:03"><subtitle>
BoJack, it's okay.No one's gonna talk to any--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:06"><subtitle>
Reporters? With questions aboutmy good friend, BoJack Horseman?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:09"><subtitle>
I'd be delighted to talk!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:12"><subtitle>
<description>theme music playing</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:06"><subtitle>
<description>music playing over stereo</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:09"><subtitle>
Oh, Baxter,my endlessly encouraging enfianced.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:12"><subtitle>
I'm thrilled to report our returnfrom a prolonged New Mexican exodus.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:15"><subtitle>
True, Max and I shared lodgingto husband our expenditures,and true, too, we showered togetherone night when the tank broke downand the hot water was scarce,but other than those mild inconveniences,the fact-finding mission went as fineas the print at the bottomof a contract,and we're close as everto sewing things up.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:28"><subtitle>
So, BoJack sold the restaurantto Joey Pogo and me,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:31"><subtitle>
and we relaunched it withmy fianc√©e Pickles as a themed eatery.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:36"><subtitle>
What is the theme?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:37"><subtitle>
Pickles wanted small plates,Joey wanted lazy Susans,and I wanted the theme to be my faceis on the front of the menu.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:43"><subtitle>
So, we did all three! <description>laughs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:45"><subtitle>
-What's the big idea?-I'm in the middle of eating!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:47"><subtitle>
Huh? It's the perfect compromisebecause everybody got what they wanted,and nobody had to compromise!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:52"><subtitle>
-And why is it called Ele-fee-no?-Ele-fi-no.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:56"><subtitle>
Well, if you don't know, hell if I know!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:58"><subtitle>
I know this last storyis taking its sweet time,but once we can tie downthis Bo-Person Horse-fellow to Sarah Lynnon the night of her death,we'll know he procured the final blow,the blow being not blow but horse,a scoop in itself,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:07"><subtitle>
but I believe the larger story is--Oh, but here I am bending your ear.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:12"><subtitle>
Your everlasting patience inspires me.Do return my call. This is Paige Sinclair.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:18"><subtitle>
-And then I took the boat back to LA.-That's it? How's that a story?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:23"><subtitle>
You did nothing illegal, and eventhe not illegal thing, you didn't even do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:26"><subtitle>
And yet this thing continuesto haunt me, I--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:29"><subtitle>
-Because it's not about the legality.-<description>Todd</description> Diane's right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:32"><subtitle>
That story is super sketchy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:34"><subtitle>
-Is BoJack super sketchy? Yes, he is!-<description>Ruthie laughs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:37"><subtitle>
-<description>pounds on door</description>-Can Horse Professor come out?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:40"><subtitle>
 We won't go to the cast partyunless our fearless teacher comes with us!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:44"><subtitle>
Why don't you just have the party hereand he'll pop out when he's ready.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:47"><subtitle>
Here's some cash.Go buy some nice cast party things.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:50"><subtitle>
<description>students cheering</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:51"><subtitle>
<description>Joshua</description> This is gonna bethe best night ever!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:53"><subtitle>
Okay, okay, you're right.I've been sketchy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:56"><subtitle>
But there's no story here. Right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:57"><subtitle>
-Unless New Mexico isn't the story.-Uh, what?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:01"><subtitle>
I'm just saying, if I tried to pitchthat story, no one would publish it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:04"><subtitle>
They're working on something bigger.What did you do this time?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:07"><subtitle>
I haven't done anything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:08"><subtitle>
Since I got out of rehabI have been on my best behavior.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:11"><subtitle>
But before rehab...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:13"><subtitle>
No. They can't get me on old shit.I'm a different person now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:16"><subtitle>
-This could be anything.-Or a combination of things.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:18"><subtitle>
They're gonna combo me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:19"><subtitle>
Let's take a beatand figure out what this story is.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:21"><subtitle>
-Todd, earmuffs.-On it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:23"><subtitle>
BoJack, tell us every bad thingyou ever did.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:27"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description> This is gonna be a long night.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:31"><subtitle>
So, what can I tell you about BoJack?Nothing bad, though. <description>laughs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:35"><subtitle>
It's gonna be a short night!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:37"><subtitle>
-Right. I-- Your chair, Miss Sinclair.-Thanks, Mr. Banks.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:42"><subtitle>
And thank you, Mr. Peanutbutter,for taking the time to quench our queries.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:45"><subtitle>
This shouldn't take more thana half hour, max.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:47"><subtitle>
-Yes?-No, not you Max.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:49"><subtitle>
-Then who Max?-No, Max. I'm talking to Mr. Peanutbutter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:51"><subtitle>
No, you're talking to Max.I'm Mr. Peanutbutter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:54"><subtitle>
Now I'm talking to Mr. Peanutbutter.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:56"><subtitle>
-Glad we're all on the same page.-I beg your pardon.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:58"><subtitle>
Mr. Peanutbutter,we have sitch in the kitch.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:01"><subtitle>
It's a dishwash ish.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:04"><subtitle>
-The dishwashers all quit?-It's the small plates.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:07"><subtitle>
If we just had bigger plates,we could get more stuff on themand we wouldn't need so many.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:10"><subtitle>
The point of the small platesis to curate a personalizeddining experience,but because of your lazy Susans,all the plates keep getting spun aroundand nobody remembers who ordered what!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:21"><subtitle>
Oof! And then there's me,putting my picture on the menu!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:24"><subtitle>
-What? No one cares about that.-Yeah, the pic's not the problem.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:27"><subtitle>
All right. JoPo... go, why don't you starton those dishes?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:30"><subtitle>
You got it, good buddy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:32"><subtitle>
Oh... <description>sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:34"><subtitle>
Pickles, you keep manning the tables.Those Susans aren't gonna laze themselves.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:38"><subtitle>
Sure. But...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:39"><subtitle>
Could I talk to you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:42"><subtitle>
How much longer do we haveto keep working with that guy?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:44"><subtitle>
I thought you loved Joey Pogo!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:46"><subtitle>
I love his music!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:47"><subtitle>
He's my second favorite recording artistafter Lo-Fi Chill-Hop Beatsto study/relax to.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:52"><subtitle>
I love Lo-Fi Chill-Hop Beatsto study/relax to!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:55"><subtitle>
And I love you!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:57"><subtitle>
But Joey Pogo's like your total opposite!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:00"><subtitle>
He's arrogant, annoyingly cheerful,and fake-nice.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:04"><subtitle>
You are confident,refreshingly optimistic,and wryly sweetwith an ironic self-aware edgethat reads to some as inauthentic,but I recognize as archly sincere!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:12"><subtitle>
Total opposites!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:14"><subtitle>
Okay. So, Pogo's not gonna work,but I guess we keep trying?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:18"><subtitle>
I can proposition some young men on set.That should end well.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:21"><subtitle>
No, I'm sorry. I want this to work.I'll try to make it work. For us.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:29"><subtitle>
Now, if we're to finish this story,we need to stay focused.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:31"><subtitle>
The last days of Sarah Lynn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:34"><subtitle>
I'm telling you, the story is biggerthan just the one girl!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:36"><subtitle>
If we pivot our perspectiveso we prove a larger pattern,we can paint a clearer portraitof a problematic personfor a page-one profilethat'll pave our path to a Pulitzer!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:44"><subtitle>
Paige, please! At the rate we're going,we'll never file the story,you'll remain unmarried,and I'll be stuck bickering with youuntil the day I die!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:50"><subtitle>
Oh, poor baby.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:51"><subtitle>
Sorry, where were we?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:52"><subtitle>
-We wanted to ask you about Sarah Lynn.-Oh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:55"><subtitle>
Before we do, let's widen our frame a tad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:57"><subtitle>
Oh, brother.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:58"><subtitle>
-Would you say BoJack is a good person?-Unequivocally, more or less.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:01"><subtitle>
-More-more or more-less?-Uh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:04"><subtitle>
Yes, but back to Sarah Lynn--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:05"><subtitle>
We're trying to understand if your friendhas ever exhibited certain patterns...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:09"><subtitle>
Argyle? Herringbone?That man can pull off anything!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:12"><subtitle>
We're wasting time. Did Sarah Lynn ac--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:14"><subtitle>
-<description>dishes crash</description>-Whoa!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:15"><subtitle>
I told you not to spin it that fast!Lazy! Lazy!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:19"><subtitle>
I'm lazy? Aren't you supposed to bewashing dishes?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:22"><subtitle>
<description>both panting</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:24"><subtitle>
-<description>scoffs</description>-Hey! Where are you going?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:27"><subtitle>
Okay, let the cat out of the bagso my curiosity can kill it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:30"><subtitle>
What is going on with those two?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:32"><subtitle>
That's a personal matter.I'll tell you all about it!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:36"><subtitle>
<description>students</description> Cast party! Cast party!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:38"><subtitle>
We are having a cast party! <description>cheers</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:41"><subtitle>
-<description>student 1</description> Yeah!-They didn't even buy alcohol!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:43"><subtitle>
Just a disco ball and some capes?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:45"><subtitle>
These are all the bad thingsyou think you did?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:47"><subtitle>
-I swear, this is all I can think of!-None of these are big stories!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:51"><subtitle>
-We all know there are more things.-Jesus Christ.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:53"><subtitle>
What's the point of working on myselfand getting sober and getting betterif no matter what, there are peopleout there just waiting to tear me down?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:00"><subtitle>
-BoJack, no.-No, it's not fair.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:02"><subtitle>
If you start listing every single thingeveryone's done,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:04"><subtitle>
-then everyone's a monster.-Nobody's--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:06"><subtitle>
Who are these reporters, anyway?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:08"><subtitle>
They're so perfect? I'll betthere's dirt on them we could dig up!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:10"><subtitle>
-I don't think that's it---That'll teach those bloodthirsty leecheswhat happens when they try to tearsomeone down over their pastwithout even considering the possibilitythat he's changed!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:18"><subtitle>
-Have you changed?-Yes, obviously.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:21"><subtitle>
Because this feels like old BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:24"><subtitle>
I like the BoJack who's thoughtfuland directs plays</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:28"><subtitle>
that are emotionally resonant despitethe glaring logical gaps in the plot.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:32"><subtitle>
It was a showcase of separate scenes!There was no plot!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:36"><subtitle>
I need to go put Ruthie to bed.Call me when new BoJack's back.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:39"><subtitle>
<description>door opens, closes</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:44"><subtitle>
You didn't do any of the dishes?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:46"><subtitle>
Manual labor featuring meis just not a fruitful collab.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:49"><subtitle>
So I just went outand bought 500 new ones.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:51"><subtitle>
Why did Mister think I'd like you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:54"><subtitle>
When I'm with him,we finish each other's sentences.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:57"><subtitle>
Meanwhile, you are always--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:58"><subtitle>
Interrupting, just to saythe exact thing that you were going to?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:01"><subtitle>
-Yes! It's so---Annoying?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:03"><subtitle>
Thank you. That's the word.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:04"><subtitle>
Hey, I don't wanna be here either.You know Joey Pogo wants to bounce.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:08"><subtitle>
What if we just tell Misterwe've formed an emotional bond,then we can have sex,and we'll never haveto see each other again!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:17"><subtitle>
-Why don't we just tell him we had sex?-I can't lie to my fianc√© about sex!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:20"><subtitle>
That's what got us into this messin the first place!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:27"><subtitle>
<description>scoffs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:29"><subtitle>
So, as soon as they go to bedwith each other,we can put this whole thing to bed,but the problem is...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:33"><subtitle>
-She loves him.-No, the opposite.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:35"><subtitle>
No, the opposite of the opposite.The very thing itself: she loves him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:40"><subtitle>
Why do you say that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:41"><subtitle>
You've got irises, haven't you?And pupils and corneas?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:44"><subtitle>
You might even say you've gota pair of eyes. Optic nerve?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:47"><subtitle>
Yes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:48"><subtitle>
So how could you not see the way thatshe follows him across the restaurantlike the puppy dog she is?How they bicker and flirt?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:54"><subtitle>
Why would she fallfor a dashing cad like Joey Pogowhen she's already engaged to sweet,dependable, predictable, safe, boring,perfectly adequate Mr. Peanutbutter?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:03"><subtitle>
Thank you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:04"><subtitle>
She only tolerates that other fellowbecause she has to, for work.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:07"><subtitle>
Otherwise she finds himutterly distasteful.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:09"><subtitle>
Piggish even! No offense to me.None taken, of course. <description>snorts</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:12"><subtitle>
No, she loves him,though she'd never admit it,even to herself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:17"><subtitle>
<description>gasps</description> And what about the boy?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:19"><subtitle>
Sure, he puts up a frontand picks a good fight,but to just once hearthose stupid words "I love you"tumble out of her foolish mouthwould drop his heart downan elevator shaftand bounce it back up to his throat.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:29"><subtitle>
-Yes?-Yes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:33"><subtitle>
-I'm pretty sure they hate each other.-Uh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:35"><subtitle>
I... Well, that's all very...<description>breathing rapidly</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:38"><subtitle>
-Back to BoJack!-And Sarah Lynn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:40"><subtitle>
Would you sayBoJack's relationship with herever bordered on inappropriatein the weeks leading up to her death?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:46"><subtitle>
No! They were closer than thieves!They were thieves, actually.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:50"><subtitle>
They broke into my house together,like great friends do,and stole our clothes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:53"><subtitle>
Ask Diane, she never got that jacket back!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:56"><subtitle>
But she was able to find another oneshortly thereafterthat looked exactly the same.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:00"><subtitle>
-Pardon me.-Hello. Joseph?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:02"><subtitle>
Can I get an announcement drumroll,please?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:04"><subtitle>
<description>beatboxing</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:07"><subtitle>
Never mind.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:08"><subtitle>
Joey and I have developed feelingsfor each other.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:11"><subtitle>
Oh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:12"><subtitle>
<description>sputtering</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:14"><subtitle>
Wow, I didn't think so soon, but--No, that's wonderful.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:17"><subtitle>
It's exactly what we wanted.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:18"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:13:49"><subtitle>
What are we spinning?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:50"><subtitle>
You went on a bender with her,at some point you split up and she died.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:55"><subtitle>
That's the story, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:57"><subtitle>
If you want us to help you,you need to tell us what's coming.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:01"><subtitle>
You know what I thought?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:02"><subtitle>
The first thing I thoughtwhen I heard Sarah Lynn died?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:05"><subtitle>
Poor BoJack,that he had to find her like that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:08"><subtitle>
That's right.Poor BoJack, that's the angle!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:11"><subtitle>
But then I kept thinking.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:12"><subtitle>
I wish I didn't,but my stupid brain kept thinking.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:16"><subtitle>
She died of a heroin overdose, yeah?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:17"><subtitle>
And you had heroin, "BoJack" brand,you kept it in your glove compartment.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:21"><subtitle>
-Diane...-I didn't wanna think about it,but I couldn't help but wonder.Did you give it to her?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:26"><subtitle>
I... Uh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:29"><subtitle>
-Yes.-And then what?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:30"><subtitle>
-You just abandoned her?-No, I--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:31"><subtitle>
You just left her alone,an addict, with heroin?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:34"><subtitle>
I didn't leave her, I was with her!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:36"><subtitle>
I was with her the whole time!I was with her when she died!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:40"><subtitle>
-Like "with her" with her?-In the planetarium.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:44"><subtitle>
I left and came backand pretended I'd found her that way.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:47"><subtitle>
I... I've never told anyone that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:49"><subtitle>
That's really bad, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:51"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:53"><subtitle>

And did you notice my pictureon the front of the menu?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:01"><subtitle>
Uh, sure. I mean that partI could take or leave,but the small plates and lazy Susanswork together perfectlyto form a completely new kindof upscale dining experience.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:10"><subtitle>
Exactly like dim sum,but with white people food,so it's more accessible.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:13"><subtitle>
-Oh, well, thank you.-Huh! Tragic, isn't it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:18"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:45"><subtitle>
And you have no ideahow torn up he was with Sarah Lynn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:47"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:51"><subtitle>
-He actually gave her the heroin!-Oh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:53"><subtitle>
Yeah. He told me that oncewhen he was drunk,and then he said,"I've never told anybody that."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:58"><subtitle>
Because he's modest.So why don't you just leave him alone?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:01"><subtitle>
<description>huffs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:04"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:25"><subtitle>
What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:26"><subtitle>
I'd better hightail it to the officeand put ink on paper.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:28"><subtitle>
But what about establishinga larger pattern of behavior?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:30"><subtitle>
We still haven't heard backfrom the New Mexico girlor our contactat the rehabilitation clinic.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:36"><subtitle>
Don't you think we oughtto keep working together?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:38"><subtitle>
No, I think I ought to get married.You were right all along, Banks, my boy.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:19:04"><subtitle>
So, what happens?When the story comes out, what do I do?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:07"><subtitle>
A statement about how sorry you areabout certain parts of the storybut other parts of the storyjust aren't true.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:13"><subtitle>
No, you--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:14"><subtitle>
Then in everyone's headyou've apologized for the really bad stuffwithout legally implicating yourself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:21"><subtitle>
-Does that work?-All the time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:22"><subtitle>
No, it doesn't.Why are you telling him to lie?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:25"><subtitle>
Because this is good.This BoJack here is good.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:29"><subtitle>
This is working, but it's so precarious.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:32"><subtitle>
Well, I'm not gonna losemy job here, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:34"><subtitle>
The Sarah Lynn stuff,that has nothing to do with this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:37"><subtitle>
-Right.-No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:38"><subtitle>
You're about to get pushed out of a plane,and the two of you are talkinglike you're trying to brainstorm waysto get back on the plane.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:44"><subtitle>
That's not gonna happen.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:45"><subtitle>
You can try to find a parachuteor you can dive headfirst into the earth,but the plane is gone.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:50"><subtitle>
You're seeing things in absolutes.We can wriggle out of this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:54"><subtitle>
-Who's "we"?-Diane, I'm asking you for help.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:56"><subtitle>
This job is my lifeline.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:58"><subtitle>
I think you should do the hard thingand be honest.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:02"><subtitle>
About everything. Things will get worsebefore they get better,but you won't spend the rest of your lifewaiting for the other shoe to drop.</subtitle>
