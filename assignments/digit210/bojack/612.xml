These schmoozey charlatans will pour syrupall over this stack of Shinolaand try to tell you it's pancakes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:57"><subtitle>
And I'm powerless to prevent it!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:58"><subtitle>
Don't you have enough dirtfor a whole other story?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:00"><subtitle>
You know full wellonce I become Baxter's bride,</subtitle>

I shall miss making mincemeatof the misdeeds of mischievous miscreants,but I must focus on my new mission,as I transition from miss to missus.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:23"><subtitle>
Huh, they're really hyping upthis BoJack interview.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:26"><subtitle>
I gotta admit I'm kinda curious.You're gonna watch, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:29"><subtitle>
No. I can't waste my energygetting worked up about that guy, Guy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:32"><subtitle>
I've done enough of that.Like, years of that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:34"><subtitle>
-Yeah, but it's not like you can just---I need to work on my book.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:37"><subtitle>
These mall-related mysteriesaren't gonna solve themselves.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:39"><subtitle>
Spoken like a very emotionallyhealthy woman,productive professional writerand super-cute girlfriend.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:44"><subtitle>
We already know what BoJack's gonna say.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:46"><subtitle>
He'll admit to everything in the story,but nothing else.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:48"><subtitle>
He'll trot out this sad-sack routine,everyone will feel bad for him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:51"><subtitle>
He'll talk about his addictions.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:52"><subtitle>
"Showbiz is awful.My parents were abusive."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:54"><subtitle>
He'll say he's changed.That he's not that guy anymore.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:56"><subtitle>
-Yeah. You sound real done with it.-I am! I'm just saying.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:59"><subtitle>
They'll make you feel bad for him,without it being too sad...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:01"><subtitle>
...because too sad is a bring-down.We wanna shoot for pensive.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:05"><subtitle>
And this will keep youfrom talking with your hands,which can be construed as aggressive.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:09"><subtitle>
And whatever you do, don't get defensive!Don't deny anything, and don't argue.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:13"><subtitle>
-<description>sighs</description>-Give me a smile.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:15"><subtitle>
Uh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:16"><subtitle>
Whoa! Am I my third favoriteBruce Springsteen song</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:19"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:25"><subtitle>
Do you need to be here right now?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:27"><subtitle>
Since your interview is leadinginto the season finale of "Birthday Dad,"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:30"><subtitle>
I wanted to officially welcome youto the MBN Thursday Night family.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:34"><subtitle>
Thank you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:35"><subtitle>
And to ask if it wouldn't betoo much trouble for you</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:37"><subtitle>
to shout out "Birthday Dad"during your interview?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:40"><subtitle>
-Why would I---But only if the interview is going well.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:42"><subtitle>
If the interview is going poorly,please do not bring up "Birthday Dad."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:46"><subtitle>
-<description>baby cooing</description>-Hey, Princess Carolyn, I-- Oh. BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:48"><subtitle>
-Getting ready for the interview?-Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:50"><subtitle>
Oh! You've got your work cut out for you,because people hate you right now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:55"><subtitle>
-I'm aware, thank you.-That story... Wow.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:57"><subtitle>
Really well-written, huh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:59"><subtitle>
Yeah, the power of the prosewas not the first thing I noticed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:02"><subtitle>
Haunting.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:04"><subtitle>
Anyway, Princess Carolyn,is it cool if I take tomorrow night offfor a date with Maude?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:09"><subtitle>
Todd, I keep hearing aboutthis new girlfriend of yours.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:12"><subtitle>
When do I meet her?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:13"><subtitle>
You can probably take this partof the conversation elsewhere.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:16"><subtitle>
Right this way.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:17"><subtitle>
We should go on a double datewith you and Pickles!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:19"><subtitle>
Pickles and I are putting our relayshon a brief hiate at the mo,but as soon as she returnsfrom her work trip...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:23"><subtitle>
-<description>phone buzzes</description>-Uh, oh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:24"><subtitle>
Excuse me, I'm receiving a text messageand it appears we have broken up forever.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:31"><subtitle>
-You're gonna be great.-<description>exhales</description> Yeah. Where are we doing this?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:34"><subtitle>
I got them to take the "Philbert" setout of storage.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:36"><subtitle>
Why?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:37"><subtitle>
Because we want the intimacyand vulnerability of your home.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:39"><subtitle>
You're saying, "This is me. No more lies."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:43"><subtitle>
But since we're pre-taping itin the afternoon,we're using the set to make it looklike it's nighttime.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:47"><subtitle>
Makes sense.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:48"><subtitle>
<description>jingle playing</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:52"><subtitle>
I'm here with BoJack Horsemanin his actual house.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:56"><subtitle>
BoJack, a story came out this morningabout the last days of Sarah Lynn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:00"><subtitle>
How did it make you feel?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:01"><subtitle>
Honestly? I felt relievedthat now I can stop lying.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:05"><subtitle>
-<description>light crashes</description>-<description>grunts</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:08"><subtitle>
-Are the allegations in the story true?-<description>clears throat</description> They are.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:11"><subtitle>
Sarah Lynn was nine months sober.I invited her on a bender.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:14"><subtitle>
We spiraled together for a little overa month and then she overdosed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:17"><subtitle>
On heroin you purchased for her?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:19"><subtitle>
-Well, I didn't purchase it for her---There's no need to get defensive.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:22"><subtitle>
I'm just trying to be accurate.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:24"><subtitle>
I-I didn't purchase it at all.I just had it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:26"><subtitle>
<description>Biscuits</description> You just had heroin?Lying around.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:28"><subtitle>
No, no, no, no, not lying around.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:30"><subtitle>
<description>scoffs</description> You're making it soundlike I had extra heroin,because I do so much heroin.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:34"><subtitle>
I had that heroinbecause I wasn't doing heroin.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:37"><subtitle>
So, I had it. You understand?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:39"><subtitle>
In your original statement to the police,you said she called you,you came to the planetarium and found her.That was a lie.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:46"><subtitle>
Yes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:47"><subtitle>
Would you say Sarah Lynn dyingwas your rock bottom?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:50"><subtitle>
I don't believe in rock bottoms.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:52"><subtitle>
I've had a lot of what I thoughtwere rock bottoms only to discover</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:55"><subtitle>
-another rockier bottom underneath.-That sounds dangerous.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:59"><subtitle>
Eventually, I decided to stop waitingfor something to change me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:03"><subtitle>
I had to make the change myself.And that's why I went to rehab.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:06"><subtitle>
And I'm very proud to be one year sobernext month.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:08"><subtitle>
So, if I'm understanding you correctly,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:09"><subtitle>
Sarah Lynn dyingwas part of that decision?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:12"><subtitle>
Uh, it was part of it, yes.Uh, I've made a lot of mistakes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:17"><subtitle>
Can you share some of thoseother mistakes?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:19"><subtitle>
I... I don't thinkthat it would be fair to the peoplewho were affected by those mistakes,all of whom I've apologized to in private.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:26"><subtitle>
Now that you're sober,do you think you'll stopmaking these mistakes?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:29"><subtitle>
I do. It's been a lot of work,but I look back at that other BoJackand I think, "Who is that?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:34"><subtitle>
And who was he?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:37"><subtitle>
I came from a broken home,and I used to feel like my whole lifewas an acting job.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:42"><subtitle>
Just doing an impression of the peopleI saw on television,which was just the projection of a bunchof equally screwed-up writers and actors.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:49"><subtitle>
I felt like a Xerox of a Xeroxof a person, you know what I mean?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:53"><subtitle>
-But not anymore?-No. Now I feel like me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:57"><subtitle>
It must have been difficultto see those same patternsrepeat themselves with Sarah Lynn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:01"><subtitle>
I think that's why her deathwas so scary for me,why I didn't wanna confront it,because she reminded me of myself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:10"><subtitle>
Some have accused Sarah Lynn's motherof exploiting her death.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:12"><subtitle>
When you hear "All Twerk and No Play"in a Geico commercial,or see Sarah Lynn's face on a billboardwith the slogan "I'd die for a Pepsi,"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:20"><subtitle>
-how does that make you feel?-Sad. Angry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:23"><subtitle>
Honestly, it feels likethat's what killed her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:25"><subtitle>
Not the heroin?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:26"><subtitle>
No, you're right.It was mostly the heroin.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:29"><subtitle>
If you could talk to her mother now,what would you say to her?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:32"><subtitle>
I would say... I wish you could know...how sorry I am.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:40"><subtitle>
<description>gasps</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:44"><subtitle>
-Am I crazy or did I nail that?-It was good.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:47"><subtitle>
Oh, man, when she brought upSarah Lynn's mother?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:49"><subtitle>
She was setting me upto throw her under the bus,but then I said I'm sorry?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:53"><subtitle>
I mean, that was a sweet move, yeah?I felt like I could see The Matrix!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:57"><subtitle>
You've definitely gottenyour 10,000 hours inwhen it comes to apologizing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:01"><subtitle>
It was good, right?People are gonna like it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:03"><subtitle>
Yeah, well, we'll find out in three hourswhen it airs.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:10"><subtitle>
And that's why the band Chicagois not one of the top ten Chicago bandsof all time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:15"><subtitle>
Uh-huh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:18"><subtitle>
Hmm, it's okayif you wanna watch. All right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:20"><subtitle>
He's your friend, it's a big deal for him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:22"><subtitle>
-You don't have to be so weird about it.-I'm not being weird. I'm in a good place.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:25"><subtitle>
I don't wanna get dragged backinto that other stuff.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:28"><subtitle>
That's great! But, you know,it is a little weirdthat one of your best friendsis a huge celebrity</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:32"><subtitle>
-and you never wanna talk about him.-Roxy's really more my "best" best friend.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:35"><subtitle>
But you never talk about Roxy either!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:36"><subtitle>
I don't understand what her job isand it's too late for me to ask.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:39"><subtitle>
And you were also marriedto a huge celebrity.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:41"><subtitle>
And you never talk about him either.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:42"><subtitle>
You don't share your past life with me.You wanna talk about weird?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:45"><subtitle>
I've lived here six monthsand I still haven't met your son.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:48"><subtitle>
<description>stammers</description> Okay. But you don't reallywanna meet Sonny.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:52"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:21"><subtitle>
As a recovering addict myself,I was spellbound!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:25"><subtitle>
Wow. I had no idea.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:26"><subtitle>
And I see no reasonwhy you shouldn't return to Wesleyan.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:31"><subtitle>
Uh, small latte?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:32"><subtitle>
-My manager told me not to charge you.-What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:34"><subtitle>
He said he watchedyour interview last night,then turned off the TVand went straightto his first AA meeting.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:39"><subtitle>
Huh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:40"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:09:49"><subtitle>
You delivered MBNthe best ratings we've seen in years!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:51"><subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:10:03"><subtitle>
I wanna strike while the iron is hotand do a part two tonight.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:06"><subtitle>
-Part two?-There is no part two.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:07"><subtitle>
It's right there in the title,"The Last Days of Sarah Lynn."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:11"><subtitle>
Just sit down with Biscuits againand tell a few more colorful anecdotesfrom your years partying in Hollywoo.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:17"><subtitle>
Then, an encore presentationof the "Birthday Dad" finale.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:20"><subtitle>
Makes sense.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:21"><subtitle>
We got what we wanted out of this.I don't think we should push it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:24"><subtitle>
We're starting a dialogue.I'm helping people.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:27"><subtitle>
Move over, Sad Dog.Make room for Remorse Horse!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:30"><subtitle>
That's great BoJack, but--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:31"><subtitle>
Listen, I'm ready to move onand go back to Connecticut,but it does feel good to be partof the conversation again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:37"><subtitle>
And if my openness and candorabout addiction is helping people,then I'm kind of a dickif I don't do another interview, right?</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:00"><subtitle>
Oh, here we go.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:02"><subtitle>
Speaking of addicts,I think you're addicted to Sarah Lynn!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:04"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description> You told the policeyou weren't with her when she died.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:07"><subtitle>
That she called you from the planetarium.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:09"><subtitle>
Yes, I lied.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:10"><subtitle>
Weren't you afraid the police would checkthe phone records?</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:11:13"><subtitle>
Oh! Well, I wasn't thinking clearly.Guess I'm not a criminal mastermind!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:16"><subtitle>
But the police did checkthe phone records,and your story checked out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:20"><subtitle>
There was a two-minute phone callmade from her phone to your phone,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:23"><subtitle>
17 minutes before you called 911.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:27"><subtitle>
-Oh?-If you were with her,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:29"><subtitle>
-how do you explain the phone call?-I, um...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:32"><subtitle>
I called myself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:33"><subtitle>
After I realized what had had happened,I took her phone and I called myselfso I could make it look likeshe called me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:39"><subtitle>
-Why?-I went into panic mode.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:41"><subtitle>
And then what did you do?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:42"><subtitle>
I thought we were gonna talkabout other stuff.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:44"><subtitle>
What did you do after you calledyour own phone, BoJack?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:46"><subtitle>
I went outside to the parking lot.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:48"><subtitle>
And you just waited there for 17 minutes?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:52"><subtitle>
Why are you asking about this?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:57"><subtitle>
Biscuits Braxby.Paige Sinclair. You've been had.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:59"><subtitle>
A pleasure to meet you. Had by who?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:01"><subtitle>
The pleasure is mine,the pronoun is whom,and the whom is the horse.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:04"><subtitle>
BoJack? I got him to spill his gutsabout the worst moment of his life</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:07"><subtitle>
on national television for huge ratings.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:10"><subtitle>
Your disgusting displayof soft-pedaling sycophancymade me wanna quitthe journalism business altogether,two days prior to when I get marriedand quit the journalismbusiness altogether.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:18"><subtitle>
But the Biscuits Braxby brandis keeping things light.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:20"><subtitle>
Celebs come on my showbecause I make 'em look good.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:22"><subtitle>
That access keeps me relevant.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:24"><subtitle>
But to what benefit is your relevanceif it's squanderedin the service of public relations?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:28"><subtitle>
With the advent of social media,celebs don't need youto make them look good.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:31"><subtitle>
And if you don't alter your strategy soon,you'll have no career left to save.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:34"><subtitle>
Face it, chinchilla, you're all wet.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:37"><subtitle>
Well, I...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:38"><subtitle>
Ugh! Even if I wanted to do a hard-hittinginterview, what would I say?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:42"><subtitle>
I've a few ideas...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:46"><subtitle>
-You keep looking over to your manager.-Well, I--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:48"><subtitle>
-Can we talk about your relationship?-Princess Carolyn?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:50"><subtitle>
-You dated her for seven years?-Yes, and look! She's alive.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:53"><subtitle>
Did it ever get complicated,working with her while maintaininga sexual relationship?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:58"><subtitle>
Well, she's always been goodat keeping her personaland professional lives separate.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:01"><subtitle>
-Quite an accomplished woman.-You said it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:03"><subtitle>
She was an agent's assistantwhen I met herand now she's running her own company.Plus, she's a great mom.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:09"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description> Oh, fish! Mom!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:11"><subtitle>
-I forgot about Todd's date!-I can watch Ruthie for a few hours.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:14"><subtitle>
<description>whispers</description> Thank you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:15"><subtitle>
What can you tell meabout Marcy Jerominek?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:18"><subtitle>
-Who?-In the '90s, you had a fan club--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:19"><subtitle>
-How do you know all this?-Do you know where I'm going here?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:22"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description> Marcy. Yes.She was the president of my fan club.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:25"><subtitle>
You slept with her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:26"><subtitle>
We had a lovely evening together.We both got something out of it, and--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:30"><subtitle>
Did you take a high school girlto her prom?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:33"><subtitle>
-That was a family friend.-Did you help a teen momsneak out of rehaband take her to a high school party?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:38"><subtitle>
I didn't take her. We went together.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:40"><subtitle>
Is it true you once dated a womanwho'd just woken upfrom a 30-year coma?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:43"><subtitle>
-Were you attracted to her naiveté, too?-What does all this have to with--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:46"><subtitle>
You had sex with the presidentof your fan club.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:48"><subtitle>
You had sex with your agent's assistant.You party with underage girls.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:52"><subtitle>
-You don't see a pattern here?-It's not a pattern.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:54"><subtitle>
-Do you enjoy having power over women?-I don't even know what that means.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:57"><subtitle>
You don't know what it meansto have power over women?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:59"><subtitle>
I don't have power over anyone.I barely have power over myself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:03"><subtitle>
But you do have power over people.And again and again, you abuse that power.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:07"><subtitle>
All these women that you mentioned,I never forced myself--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:10"><subtitle>
Not through force,but you understand the power differential.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:12"><subtitle>
So, I can't be with any womanI might have power over?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:16"><subtitle>
-Who does that leave me with?-I'm just pointing out a series of--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:18"><subtitle>
You think everythingis this nefarious scheme.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:21"><subtitle>
Most of the bad shitthat happens in this worldisn't because of wicked plotsand machinations.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:25"><subtitle>
It's just because we're alla bunch of stupid, hungry,horny little goons just grabbing at shit,hoping it'll press that little buttonin our brain that says,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:33"><subtitle>
"Okay, you're happy now."That's not an "abuse of power."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:37"><subtitle>
Do you really believe you didn't havethe power in all of those relationships?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:41"><subtitle>
I... I am an addict.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:44"><subtitle>
One of the first things that I hadto accept was my own powerlessness.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:47"><subtitle>
-But that's---I understand what I did was wrong.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:49"><subtitle>
I'm not denying that.But you're trying to paint this picture.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:51"><subtitle>
You're making it out like I'm a bad guy,and I'm not.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:54"><subtitle>
I'm not that guy you're saying I am.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:56"><subtitle>
-So, back to Sarah Lynn...-No. Why?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:58"><subtitle>
You gave her the heroin...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:59"><subtitle>
I already told you, yes.How many times can I say it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:02"><subtitle>
Breaking news! The thing I told youyesterday is still true.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:05"><subtitle>
-Did you ever give Sarah Lynn alcohol?-What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:07"><subtitle>
The first time Sarah Lynn ever got drunk,she was a child, and it was vodka, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:11"><subtitle>
How... how do you know about that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:13"><subtitle>
You were bringing vodkato the set of "Horsin' Around."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:16"><subtitle>
Who told you all this stuff?Did Sharona tell you that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:23"><subtitle>
Doctor Champ,thank you for returning my call.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:25"><subtitle>
I didn't wanna say anything,but just watching BoJackin that interview,talking like he's a victim in all this.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:31"><subtitle>
If the world only knew the thingsI know...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:34"><subtitle>
I understand as a therapist,you're not at liberty to divulgewhat your client told you in confidence.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:39"><subtitle>
But I'm not a therapist.I'm a therapy horse.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:42"><subtitle>
And I can tell you everything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:44"><subtitle>
Oh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:45"><subtitle>
Because Sharona was a drunk, too,so you can't trust a thing she says.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:48"><subtitle>
Obviously, she has a vendetta against me.Besides, I already apologized to her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:52"><subtitle>
Apologized for what?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:54"><subtitle>
Okay, when you put it all together,it looks bad.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:56"><subtitle>
Do you see any connection betweenthose other women and Sarah Lynn?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:59"><subtitle>
There's no connection between anyone,that's what I keep saying!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:02"><subtitle>
Sarah Lynn wasn't like those other girls.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:05"><subtitle>
I loved Sarah Lynn.She was like a daughter to me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:08"><subtitle>
I just keep seeing this story of youtaking young women...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:11"><subtitle>
-No.-Grooming them...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:12"><subtitle>
I didn't groom anyone, okay?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:14"><subtitle>
It's not like I got Sarah Lynn drunkfor the purposeof taking advantage of her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:17"><subtitle>
She was ten! I didn't even have sexwith her until she was 30!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:20"><subtitle>
-I'm sorry, what?-No. I just mean that--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:22"><subtitle>
-Did you say you had sex with her?-That was later. She was an adult.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:25"><subtitle>
And we were both so drunk and high,I didn't--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:28"><subtitle>
We didn't know what we were doing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:30"><subtitle>
We were addicts,and the thing about addicts--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:32"><subtitle>
-This was during your bender?-Yeah. No! A different bender.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:35"><subtitle>
I took her to rehab, by the way!I tried to get her help.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:38"><subtitle>
I just keep thinkingabout those 17 minutes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:40"><subtitle>
You waiting in the parking lotafter she died.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:44"><subtitle>
But she wasn't actually dead yet.She died in the hospital.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:47"><subtitle>
-Right, but at the time, I didn't...-Ever wonder what would've happenedif you didn't take those 17 minutes?Do you think she might still--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:53"><subtitle>
No! I... Look, obviouslywhen I did all that stuff, I wasn't--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:55"><subtitle>
So to recap, you gave Sarah Lynn alcoholwhen she was a child.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:59"><subtitle>
She then became an addict.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:01"><subtitle>
Come on, there was a lot of stuffin between--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:02"><subtitle>
I'm talking now. You're not talking.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:05"><subtitle>
When she was intoxicated,you had sex with her,and when she was sober,you gave her the heroin that killed her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:10"><subtitle>
Then in an effort to cover for yourself,you waited to call the paramedicsthat might have saved her life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:17"><subtitle>
And you don't thinkyou have any power over women.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:24"><subtitle>
So, it didn't go great.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:26"><subtitle>
The gross part is she doesn't even care.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:28"><subtitle>
This is just a ratings win she can useas leverage for her next big paycheck.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:31"><subtitle>
-Maybe.-She was all over the place.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:33"><subtitle>
I think people are gonna seethat she was just out to get me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:35"><subtitle>
-People are gonna see that, right?-I guess we'll find out tonight.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:38"><subtitle>
Okay, maybe she had some good points,but she completelyundermined herself with, like...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:43"><subtitle>
I mean, we dated for like seven years.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:45"><subtitle>
Do you think that I took advantage of you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:47"><subtitle>
-<description>sighs</description> I'm here, aren't I?-And she kept bringing it back to women--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:50"><subtitle>
These "women I hurt"because that's what's hip now, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:53"><subtitle>
Hurting women?But I have also hurt a lot of men!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:56"><subtitle>
I told you to do just the one interviewand go back to Connecticut.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:00"><subtitle>

Ugh! I am so readyto never do stand-up again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:05"><subtitle>
