I don't think it's wiseto be burning Bridges at this juncture.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:33"><subtitle>
I'm sorry, just don't like Beau.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:35"><subtitle>
-Greetings, strangers!-Maude?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:37"><subtitle>
That's what they want you to think!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:38"><subtitle>
I'm Maude's twin sister Fergus,we have never met before,and I'd be delighted to accept a jobat this company.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:44"><subtitle>
-<description>scoffs</description> What?-As you know, I have 12 children.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:47"><subtitle>
What sort of day care servicesdo you provide here?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:49"><subtitle>
Has this ever happened to you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:52"><subtitle>
Todd? At the office?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:53"><subtitle>
Can we wrap whatever this is up?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:55"><subtitle>
I'm supposed to head overto the "Birthday Dad" set.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:57"><subtitle>
I wanna run a day care at VIM!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:59"><subtitle>
I've mastered the art of lookingat one baby and I'm ready for more.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:03"><subtitle>
You do have several employeeswith children.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:05"><subtitle>
If you employ Todd through the company,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:06"><subtitle>
you could offer him a raiseand still save money on taxes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:09"><subtitle>
Great. It's done.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:10"><subtitle>
Hooray! Corporate tax loophole!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:12"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:15"><subtitle>
Which leads me to my next point.I am moving out to live with Maude.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:19"><subtitle>
It's me! It's Maude.I don't really have a twin sister.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:21"><subtitle>
Hey, that's fantastic!Where are you moving to?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:24"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:29"><subtitle>
The line is,"Thank you for the birthday pizza.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:31"><subtitle>
Today, I am your dad."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:32"><subtitle>
-Oh, sorry!-Let's take five?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:35"><subtitle>
-Hey, champ. Everything okay?-I'm just distracted.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:38"><subtitle>
Ever since Pickles left, I've beenso lonely in that big, empty house.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:41"><subtitle>
I've always had a wife or a girlfriend,someone to take care of.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:44"><subtitle>
Princess Carolyn,you're perpetually alone.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:46"><subtitle>
-How do you manage?-One day at a time, buddy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:50"><subtitle>
I went to the doctor to seeif he could make me feel better,he said, "You should check outthis Internet meme,it always cheers me up: Sad Dog."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:56"><subtitle>
And I said, "But Doctor, I am Sad Dog."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:01"><subtitle>
Guys, I'm really sorrythis keeps happening.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:05"><subtitle>
When I got home, I found my wifeand daughter had moved out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:08"><subtitle>
All they left behind was this picture.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:11"><subtitle>
-Okay. Rude.-Shh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:13"><subtitle>
It's the stock photothat came in the frame.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:15"><subtitle>
My wife kept asking me to put in a pictureof our family, but I was always too drunk.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:21"><subtitle>
But because of all of youand my sponsor Leo,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:24"><subtitle>
I'm no longer just the manwho's not in this picture.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:27"><subtitle>
I'm a different, better manwho is also not in this picture.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:31"><subtitle>
Who's next?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:34"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:37"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:41"><subtitle>
-Most people hate me...-Mm-hmm.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:43"><subtitle>
...I just lost five million dollars,so that's not great.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:45"><subtitle>
Could probably use a Leoof my own right about now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:50"><subtitle>
Wow, tough room.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:51"><subtitle>
This AA meeting is a tough room.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:00"><subtitle>
<description>sighs</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:01"><subtitle>
Hey, I'll be your sponsor.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:04"><subtitle>
Oh! Um...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:05"><subtitle>
I know what you're thinking,"Vance Waggoner?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:07"><subtitle>
That guy's gonna be my sponsor?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:08"><subtitle>
The guy Charlie Sheenonce called 'a little much'?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:11"><subtitle>
-Uh...-"Vance Waggoner?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:13"><subtitle>
That guy's got more domestic assaultconvictions than Sean Penn!"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:16"><subtitle>
And now you're thinking,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:17"><subtitle>
"Did Sean Penn get convictedof domestic assaultor was it just alleged?I gotta look that up later."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:21"><subtitle>
-I'm sure---Now you're thinking,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:22"><subtitle>
"Why would someone this cooland put-together wanna sponsor me,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:25"><subtitle>
-dumb slob BoJack Horseman?"-That's not--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:28"><subtitle>
Wait. I've been where you've been, BoJack.And everyone abandoned me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:31"><subtitle>
If you need someone to talk to,give me a call, okay?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:35"><subtitle>
My number is 555-555-8008.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:39"><subtitle>
Because sometimeslife turns you upside-down,and when you're upside-down,my number is boobs.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:53"><subtitle>
Diane! How are the revisions going?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:55"><subtitle>
Good! Usually at this stageI hate everything I've ever writtenand I feel like a worthless hack,but this book actually isn't terrible.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:02"><subtitle>
Great, so when can we expectthe not-terrible sequel,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:05"><subtitle>
"Ivy Tran Two: A Tran for All Seasons"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:08"><subtitle>
I don't know, Ivy Tran was funbut I'm a grown-up writer.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:11"><subtitle>
There are other things I wanna write.Did you know Eleanor Roosevelt--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:14"><subtitle>
-Interesting.-I didn't even tell you the thing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:17"><subtitle>
I know.I was interested in you not telling me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:19"><subtitle>
Okay, good bit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:21"><subtitle>
In the meantime,if you're interested in writing booksthat people actually read,you'll get to work on "Ivy Tran Two:Last Tran to Clarksville."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:29"><subtitle>
-Eleanor Roosevelt once---Interesting!</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:38"><subtitle>
actually called this legislationthe "Anti-Corruption Bill!"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:41"><subtitle>
That's like if BoJack Horsemanwore a T-shirt that said,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:44"><subtitle>
"I am not a ginormous dick-weasel!"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:47"><subtitle>
Hey, that is an unfair drive-by!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:49"><subtitle>
Now, I know this Photoshop is not upto our program's usual standards,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:53"><subtitle>
but in our graphic department's defense,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:55"><subtitle>
none of them could spend ten minuteslooking at this ass-weasel</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:58"><subtitle>
without their uterusesliterally throwing up.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:01"><subtitle>
-<description>phone ringing, buzzing</description>-Ugh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:05"><subtitle>
-<description>beeps</description>-Yes?</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:07:06"><subtitle>
BoJack, it's your very goodaccountant Gaz.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:08"><subtitle>
-I'm here with...-Your very good lawyer Chaz!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:11"><subtitle>
Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:12"><subtitle>
The good news is the Sarah Lynn settlementisn't gonna kill us.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:14"><subtitle>
What's the bad news?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:15"><subtitle>
The bad news is you're being suedfor a hundred million dollars.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:18"><subtitle>
-What?-Remember in your interview,when you disparagingly referredto yourself as "a Xerox of a Xerox"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:25"><subtitle>
The Xerox Corporation did not appreciatebeing implicatedin your untoward behavior.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:29"><subtitle>
Just so I'm clear, Sarah Lynn's deathcost me five million dollars,but saying something bad about a brandis gonna cost me a hundred million?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:36"><subtitle>
When you frame it that way,it almost seems comical!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:38"><subtitle>
But it is not comical,because a hundred million dollarsis a lot of money you do not have.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:43"><subtitle>
Okay, so what's the move?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:44"><subtitle>

Wow-ee! It looks better than the pictures!</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:53"><subtitle>
-"What would Todd do?"-And?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:55"><subtitle>
He'd probably scour VIM's talent listfor underemployed actors,tell them they've been hiredfor a site-specific immersivetheater piece as cosmopolitan partygoers,invite just enough real friendsto lend it an air of legitimacyand raid the "Birthday Dad" setfor furniture.</subtitle>
