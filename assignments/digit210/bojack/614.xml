<timestamp time="00:05:44"><subtitle>
I wouldn't ask you to ask.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:45"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:13"><subtitle>
The point is: helium luggage.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:53"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:56"><subtitle>
Okay. She didn't come to dinnerbecause she's ashamed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:00"><subtitle>
She can't say hello?The woman has my kidney!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:02"><subtitle>
And that's why she's ashamed.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:04"><subtitle>
A mother shouldn't owe her child her life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:07"><subtitle>
If she could turn it around somehow,save your life...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:10"><subtitle>
-But, alas, she cannot.-Huh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:12"><subtitle>

-Word to the wise, BoJack, don't get old.-I'll see what I can do about that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:58"><subtitle>
My 40-year-old companiontreats me like a fragile antique.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:01"><subtitle>
I've got a Lamborghini Miuraand she won't even let me drive it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:04"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:44"><subtitle>
-Diane!-You wrote a memoir?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:47"><subtitle>
Oh, yeah! I had the idea a few months ago,then one weekend it just fell out of me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:51"><subtitle>
-What?-From the way people talk about writing,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:53"><subtitle>
I always assumed it was very difficult,but it turns out it's not at all,literally anyone can do it!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:59"><subtitle>
Yes, that's always been my experience.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:01"><subtitle>
I loved your new book, by the way.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:03"><subtitle>
-Thanks.-I'm happy for you, Diane.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:06"><subtitle>
Even though it's really easyto write a book,it's still an accomplishmentto be proud of.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:10"><subtitle>
-I am.-And how's Chicago?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:12"><subtitle>
Are you a Chicagoan yet?You know, I went to school in Chicago.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:15"><subtitle>
You went to Northwestern.That's not in Chicago.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:18"><subtitle>
Ah! You are a Chicagoan!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:20"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:23"><subtitle>
In New York? Oh, I think therethey pronounce it "Hose-town."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:26"><subtitle>
No, Texas. My boyfriend and I are going.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:35"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:38"><subtitle>
He's actually the best Guy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:43"><subtitle>
His girlfriend looks nice.He seems healthy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:46"><subtitle>
What-- What's his job?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:47"><subtitle>
I think he runs a daycare,but he talks about the babiesas if they're his co-workers,so it's impossible to know for sure.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:54"><subtitle>
-I should have been there.-We'll try again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:56"><subtitle>

Oh, no! Todd's gonna get murderedby a fearsome strangerwhose sage, buttery voice simultaneouslycomforts me and fills me with dread.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:14"><subtitle>
Sounds like a lot of rangefor a kidnapper.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:16"><subtitle>
Who are you and what do you want?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:18"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:29"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:32"><subtitle>
It's the least I can do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:33"><subtitle>
Getting you to buythat addictive video gamewas the act that set me downthis ruinous path so many years ago.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:40"><subtitle>
If I can make things right by you,maybe there's hope yetfor this wretched soul.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:59"><subtitle>
They even found your original screen test.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:01"><subtitle>
That's incredible.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:02"><subtitle>
Too bad no one will ever see it.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:28"><subtitle>
-Why?-Offensive to Susans.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:30"><subtitle>
There was a protestorganized by Susan Sarandon.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:17:37"><subtitle>
They're lazy?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:39"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:41"><subtitle>
Anyway, I don't knowhow we got talking about me for so long.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:44"><subtitle>
You were gonna tell meabout your boyfriend. It's good?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:46"><subtitle>
It's really good. When I'm with him,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:48"><subtitle>
I feel like I'm part of an "us," you know?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:50"><subtitle>
Like, every other relationship, I alwaysfelt like a "me" in a relationship.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:54"><subtitle>
Does that make sense?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:55"><subtitle>
Uh, yeah. That makes sense.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:57"><subtitle>
Sorry. I-I didn't realizeI was doing that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:00"><subtitle>
I've always tried to bean "us" with peopleeven when I could seeit wasn't a good idea.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:04"><subtitle>
Now that I'm single, I feel likeI'm finally learning how to be a "me."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:07"><subtitle>
That's great.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:08"><subtitle>
I know there were times you wouldtry to tell me somethingand instead of listening,I just tried to fix itor convince you there wasn't a problem.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:15"><subtitle>
I shouldn't have done that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:16"><subtitle>
We're all doing our best.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:18"><subtitle>
-I wanna know now.-Know what?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:20"><subtitle>
Tell me what it's like to be Diane.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:23"><subtitle>
Okay. When you're Diane,you can live your whole lifelike it's a puzzle,put togetherfrom the pieces of different sets.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:34"><subtitle>
Like a crossover puzzle?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:36"><subtitle>
Exactly.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:37"><subtitle>
Your whole life is fullof these pieces that don't quite fit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:40"><subtitle>
Sounds like a hard puzzle.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:42"><subtitle>
But at some point,you start to think it's you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:46"><subtitle>
You're the piece that doesn't quite fit.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:49"><subtitle>
And you spend so long with that feelingthat the feeling becomes your home.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:55"><subtitle>
And it can be jarringwhen you discover one daythat you suddenlydon't feel that way anymore.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:01"><subtitle>
At first, you don't trust it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:03"><subtitle>
But then, gradually, you do.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:06"><subtitle>
I'm sorry. That was a weird thingto be telling my ex-husband.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:09"><subtitle>
No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:11"><subtitle>
-I'm really happy for you, Diane.-It's funny.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:14"><subtitle>
I feel like if we met each otheras the people we are now,things would be totally different with us.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:19"><subtitle>
Yeah, but if we hadn't meteach other until now,we wouldn't be the people we are now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:26"><subtitle>
Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:27"><subtitle>
Two equally accomplished book writers.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:35"><subtitle>
You suffered an anxiety attack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:37"><subtitle>
I'd encourage you to avoidstressful situations like, uh,fake kidnappings under abandoned bridges.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:44"><subtitle>
Okay, paperwork time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:45"><subtitle>
You seem like a fellow who enjoysunnecessary bureaucracy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:49"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:51"><subtitle>
Mm, was that the bridgewhere they shot Grease?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:55"><subtitle>
-Yeah!-That's neat.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:58"><subtitle>
Todd, I'm so sorry!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:00"><subtitle>
Oh, no, I know you didn't mean to--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:02"><subtitle>
I thought kicking you outwas the right thing.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:05"><subtitle>
You were 18.You had dropped out of high school.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:08"><subtitle>
You were always high.You only wore flip-flops.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:10"><subtitle>
-You never showered.-You don't have to list everything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:13"><subtitle>
I wanted you to grow up,not leave forever.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:16"><subtitle>
Then more and more time passedand I didn't know how to make it right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:20"><subtitle>
Truth is, I did grow up. Your plan worked.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:23"><subtitle>
I haven't had a mom for so long, I...I don't really need one anymore.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:28"><subtitle>
Oh. So, what do we do now?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:31"><subtitle>
Well, I do have one idea.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:34"><subtitle>
-What?-A big robot suit like in Aliens,but for babiesso they can do grown-up things!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:40"><subtitle>
-That sounds dangerous.-Yeah, I guess it is.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:45"><subtitle>
But maybe the robots could be poweredby energy generatedfrom sucking on pacifiers.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:51"><subtitle>
That is so smart! Babies love suckingand right now it's just wasted energy!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:57"><subtitle>
<description>Margo's voice</description> And so you see,the circle had become complete.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
