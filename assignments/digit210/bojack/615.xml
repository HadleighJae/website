What you got there?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:18"><subtitle>
I think it's a hydrangea.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:20"><subtitle>
Does she even like that kind of plant?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:22"><subtitle>
Probably not. She doesn't like anything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:00:24"><subtitle>

You got here just in time, BoJack.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:01:41"><subtitle>
A bird flew in through the windowand we're having troublegetting her out of the house.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:21"><subtitle>
With a drop like that,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:23"><subtitle>
you'd think she was the ratingsfor Veronica's Closet</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:25"><subtitle>
when it moved to Mondays.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:26"><subtitle>
Ugh. Comedy poison.Who wants to laugh on a Monday?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:29"><subtitle>
BJ! Finally made itto our little soir√©e, huh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:33"><subtitle>
Yeah, I kept having this dreamwhere I was having dinner</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:35"><subtitle>
with all the people who were goneand I thought, "I should do that!"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:38"><subtitle>
So, here I am.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:41"><subtitle>
-We've got to flank her from the left.-<description>bird</description> Huh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:43"><subtitle>
Hello. Crackerjack?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:45"><subtitle>
-That's what it says on my underpants!-<description>giggles</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:47"><subtitle>
<description>grunts</description> The uncle I never metand yet could never live up to!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:50"><subtitle>
<description>grunts</description> All right, soldier. Ready, aim...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:55"><subtitle>
-<description>bird giggles</description>-Huh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:56"><subtitle>
Hey! What's up, man?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:02:58"><subtitle>
Hey, Corduroy. <description>stammers</description> Good to...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:00"><subtitle>
Still weirded out because the last timeyou saw me I was naked,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:03"><subtitle>
hanging from my iPhone charger,holding a lemon, with a very erect penis</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:06"><subtitle>
despite being deceased in my trailerfor over an hour?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:09"><subtitle>
Yep.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:10"><subtitle>
You're gonna have to get over that, buddy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:12"><subtitle>
Hmm. Mm. Ooh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:15"><subtitle>
-What are you...? Stop that.-Oh! Oh, sorry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:17"><subtitle>
Forgot where I was for a second.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:19"><subtitle>
-Think this'll help?-Kid's got the right idea.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:21"><subtitle>
We can chuck the chokerand spook her with this poker!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:25"><subtitle>
-Show her who's boss!-<description>Sarah Lynn</description> Ruffle her feathers!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:27"><subtitle>
<description>Corduroy</description> Get her to the kitchen!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:28"><subtitle>
<description>grunting</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:30"><subtitle>
And that!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:32"><subtitle>
-All right!-<description>Herb</description> Go!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:33"><subtitle>
<description>Crackerjack</description> Ha-cha!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:37"><subtitle>
-<description>Sarah Lynn cheers</description>-<description>all whooping</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:39"><subtitle>
Yes, yes, BoJack bullied a bird.Bully for him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:43"><subtitle>
Speaking of useless,my husband is running late,so we're gonna start dinner without him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:47"><subtitle>
He'll be here before the show starts,won't he?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:49"><subtitle>
He'd better be.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:50"><subtitle>
In the meantime,let's adjourn to the dining room</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:52"><subtitle>
before our dinners getas cold as my parenting style.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:57"><subtitle>
<description>all laughing</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:03:58"><subtitle>
<description>Sarah Lynn</description> I think mine would bethe first time someone askedfor my autograph.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:02"><subtitle>
-Really?-Oh, wow!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:04"><subtitle>
I didn't even know how to write my name!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:05"><subtitle>
I just drew a squiggle!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:07"><subtitle>
-Water?-Thank you, Zach Braff.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:08"><subtitle>
You only get to giveyour first autograph once, you know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:11"><subtitle>
The second time it becomes an obligation,the third time a chore.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:15"><subtitle>
But the first time...<description>sighs</description> The first time... <description>chuckles</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:18"><subtitle>
-Hey. What is that?-Ah, ah, ah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:21"><subtitle>
Shh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:24"><subtitle>
-<description>BoJack</description> Mm.-Okay. My turn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:26"><subtitle>
Mine was also when I signedon a dotted line to enlist.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:29"><subtitle>
Are you ready to sing "The Lollypop Song"in the big show later?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:33"><subtitle>
No, Mom.You know I never make it to the show.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:35"><subtitle>
I didn't know then that enlistingwould lead to my two worst parts.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:38"><subtitle>
You have two?I didn't know we could pick two.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:40"><subtitle>
Corduroy, it's a conversation,not an assignment.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:42"><subtitle>
-<description>Corduroy</description> In that case, I have three.-<description>Herb</description> Three is way too many.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:45"><subtitle>
My worst parts were saying goodbyeto my motherand seeing a bullet go straightthrough my general's face,right before it hit my own.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:51"><subtitle>
-<description>all gasp</description>-At least your death was instantaneous.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:54"><subtitle>
I can still hear the loud drips of my IVfrom when I had cancer.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:58"><subtitle>
-Drip. Drip.-Ooh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:00"><subtitle>
-<description>Corduroy</description> What about you, BoJack?-What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:02"><subtitle>
Best part, worst part, what about you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:04"><subtitle>
Well, I guess my worst parthas to be, um...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:08"><subtitle>
Right before I got here, I think? Uh...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:11"><subtitle>
I went to Angela Diaz's house.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:14"><subtitle>
<description>gulps, spits</description> Ugh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:16"><subtitle>
Does anyone else's watertaste like chlorine?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:18"><subtitle>
Hey, Braff, can I getsome different water over here?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:20"><subtitle>
Right away, Mr. Horseman.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:21"><subtitle>
Crackerjack, do you think your deathmeant somethingbecause it was in the serviceof a greater cause?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:26"><subtitle>
-Aw, shucks.-Of course it meant something.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:28"><subtitle>
I think questions like that are too bigfor a little soldier like me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:31"><subtitle>
My brother gave the ultimate sacrifice.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:33"><subtitle>
-Because sometimes I wonder---But see, this is where I get hung up,because when we valorizethe idea of sacrifice,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:39"><subtitle>
-of loss, of suffering---BoJack, don't start with this again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:41"><subtitle>
When we grow upin a house that does that,we internalize this ideathat being happy is a selfish act,but sacrifice doesn't mean anything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:50"><subtitle>
-<description>Sarah Lynn</description> Yes, it does.-Sacrifice?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:51"><subtitle>
In the service of something greater,maybe, but just in and of itself?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:55"><subtitle>
-What's the good in that?-A lot.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:56"><subtitle>
Sacrifice is good.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:58"><subtitle>
It has to be because I sacrificed a ton,and I was freaking awesome.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:02"><subtitle>
Oh, and what did you ever sacrifice?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:04"><subtitle>
I gave everything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:06"><subtitle>
I gave my whole life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:07"><subtitle>
You died in a hedonistic bender.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:09"><subtitle>
I'm not talking about my death.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:11"><subtitle>
I'm talking about my life.I gave my whole life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:15"><subtitle>
If we get into everyone's whole life,we're gonna be here all night.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:18"><subtitle>
It's called "Best Part/Worst Part,"not "Everything That Ever Happened."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:21"><subtitle>
Okay, worst part:the 2007 "Sexually Confident Virgin Tour."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:26"><subtitle>
My manager leaked nudesto get more tour dates added,my mom pointed out every carb I ate,it was hell.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:33"><subtitle>
But it gave millions of fansa show they will never forget.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:37"><subtitle>
And that is worth something.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:39"><subtitle>
No, that's a high you chase.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:40"><subtitle>
-It was not.-You think you singing songs on stageis the same thing as this guywho died liberating the camps?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:45"><subtitle>
We don't need to compareapples to Auschwitzes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:48"><subtitle>
Herb, tell 'em. It means something--the work we do, the joy we bring.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:52"><subtitle>
It has to, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:54"><subtitle>
Boy, I sure thought so.I-I used to really believe in it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:57"><subtitle>
I mean, I was one "trapped in an airportduring a snowstormon the eve of the dance championshipguest starring Gregory Hines" episodeaway from an Emmy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:05"><subtitle>
Then I lost it all.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:06"><subtitle>
Ow! Seriously, is no one noticingthis leak?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:09"><subtitle>
Fine, we'll get a bucket.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:10"><subtitle>
-The drips are hitting me!-Then you'll hold the bucket.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:12"><subtitle>
But the funny thing is,it wasn't until I got firedthat I actually became myself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:17"><subtitle>
I was out of the closet. I was free.I was authentically me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:21"><subtitle>
What does being authentichave to do with anything?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:24"><subtitle>
Well, when I wasn't hidingbehind some facade, I could be at peace.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:27"><subtitle>
That's when I really gotinto philanthropy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:30"><subtitle>
-Can I ask you something, Herb?-Why do people say that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:32"><subtitle>
If you're asking it, then yes,you can and you will and you just did.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:36"><subtitle>
Yeah, why are we announcing our questions?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:38"><subtitle>
-Yeah, what are these questions, royalty?-<description>imitates fanfare</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:42"><subtitle>
Announcing King and Queen Queryof the Interrogative Isle.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:45"><subtitle>
May I ask you how do you do?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:47"><subtitle>
-Very well, thanks.-Ah, bup, bup, bup!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:50"><subtitle>
I didn't ask you yet.I asked if I could ask you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:54"><subtitle>
Did you get pleasurefrom your charity work?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:56"><subtitle>
Like real, deep pleasure?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:57"><subtitle>
It dwarfed every other joy in my life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:59"><subtitle>
Doesn't count then.If you got pleasure, it wasn't selfless.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:02"><subtitle>
And it's only good if it's selfless.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:04"><subtitle>
Who made up that rule? I helped people.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:06"><subtitle>
Who cares if it made me feel good, too?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:09"><subtitle>
Feeling good is inherently selfish.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:11"><subtitle>
If I'd given myself to Christ,truly went down the path--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:13"><subtitle>
I don't care for this talk of religionin my house.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:18"><subtitle>
If I wasn't constantlytrying to feel good, get it better,always looking for maximum pleasure...<description>sighs</description> That was my worst part.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:25"><subtitle>
Well, one of the three worst parts.Wait, actually, can I have four?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:28"><subtitle>
Discovering you in your trailerdefinitely cracks my top five.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:31"><subtitle>
This is bullshit!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:32"><subtitle>
I did a lot for a lot of people!I was not a bad person.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:36"><subtitle>
No one is accusing youof being a bad person, Sarah Lynn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:39"><subtitle>
<description>yelling</description> You are! You all arewith your "being authentic"and "charity work" and "killing Nazis."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:45"><subtitle>
I actually never killed a Nazi.All my kills were friendly fire.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:48"><subtitle>
I also never liberated any camps.I'm honestly not sure what I did.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:52"><subtitle>
Here you go.Your husband just pulled up, ma'am.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:54"><subtitle>
Wait, Dad's here?He's never made it to dinner before.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:57"><subtitle>
-Hey, here's a question.-Another question has arrived!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:01"><subtitle>
Did any of you have a song of yoursplayed in outer space?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:05"><subtitle>
Anyone? No. Just me? Oh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:07"><subtitle>
That's what I thought.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:08"><subtitle>
My hit single "No, No, No (No Means Yes)"is making its way to Mars!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:13"><subtitle>
That means something.I will be remembered.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:15"><subtitle>
-That has to mean something. I will be---<description>door opens</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:18"><subtitle>
Sorry I'm late. Did I miss the show?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:20"><subtitle>
-Hey!-There he is! There's our guy!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:21"><subtitle>
-Dad!-I...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:22"><subtitle>
Oh, you didn't miss a thing.It's not like we have anywhere to be.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:25"><subtitle>
Why shouldn't we all bend ourselvesto your schedule?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:28"><subtitle>
I already apologized. I was running.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:30"><subtitle>
Yes. As always, running late,while I was running myself raggedtrying to get dinner on the table.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:36"><subtitle>
-<description>clears throat</description>-Yes, you helped.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:38"><subtitle>
And now I'm running out of patiencefor you running your mouth.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:41"><subtitle>
And I'm running out the clockuntil we both...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:44"><subtitle>
Well. Here we are.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:47"><subtitle>
I'll just squeeze in here.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:50"><subtitle>
-Get yourself something nice.-Ooh! Thank you, Mr. Secretariat.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:54"><subtitle>
-What'd I miss?-We're playing Best Part/Worst Part.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:56"><subtitle>
Ooh! I got one! Machu Picchu.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:58"><subtitle>
When I left "Horsin' Around,"I honestly thought about killing myself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:02"><subtitle>
Shit, Herb. Really?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:04"><subtitle>
Yeah. But the Knickswere having a good seasonand I wanted to see what happened.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:08"><subtitle>
Wait, you didn't kill yourselfbecause the Knickswere having a good season?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:11"><subtitle>
What would you have doneif they were having a bad season?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:14"><subtitle>
I don't know. Gotten into baseball?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:15"><subtitle>
Oh, for the love...Where's your follow-through?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:18"><subtitle>
It's like you didn't evenwanna kill yourself!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:20"><subtitle>
And I'm so glad I didn't.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:21"><subtitle>
Because there I was ten years laterat Machu Picchuand I realized there was so much moreI could do in a life.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:30"><subtitle>
Okay, my turn.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:31"><subtitle>
August 22nd, 1973,I was banned from running ever again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:36"><subtitle>
