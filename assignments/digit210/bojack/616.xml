</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:04:01"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:42"><subtitle>
I had this breakthrough recently.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:43"><subtitle>
One day, in therapy, I just blurted out,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:45"><subtitle>
"Is my problem with womenany movie directed by Christopher Nolan?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:48"><subtitle>
Because, yes, women are involved,but it's really never about the women.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:53"><subtitle>
It's about me."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:54"><subtitle>
-That's actually somewhat astute.-It occurred to me:</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:05:56"><subtitle>
Are my self-destructive patternsand unexamined cycles of co-dependencythe popular Jim Carrey character The Mask?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:02"><subtitle>
Because "somebody stop me"!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:04"><subtitle>
Are all of your breakthroughsphrased like that?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:06"><subtitle>
Um, are all of my breakthroughs a Britishprog-rock band from the '70s?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:09"><subtitle>
-Because yes.-Ugh!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:06:13"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:20"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:23"><subtitle>
No, obviously I meant the "Dad" partof "Birthday Dad,"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:25"><subtitle>
I assumed that went without saying.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:07:27"><subtitle>
Look, I gotta go,but the next time I need a sign made</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:26"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:28"><subtitle>
There's no time to explain.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:29"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:32"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:55"><subtitle>
-I thought you could use some air.-Oh. Thanks.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:08:58"><subtitle>
But then why are you on my shoulders?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:00"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:02"><subtitle>
-Okay, get down. Oh, okay.-<description>grunting</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:06"><subtitle>
It's good to see you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:07"><subtitle>
How'd you get out of the supermax?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:09"><subtitle>
Did a helicopter crashinto the side of the buildingand then you just walked out?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:13"><subtitle>
What? No. I'm just here for the wedding.I'm going back tomorrow.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:16"><subtitle>
Oh, bummer.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:17"><subtitle>
No, it's good.I think the routine is good for me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:20"><subtitle>
-I'm staying out of trouble, at least.-Hooray! Staying out of trouble, at least!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:25"><subtitle>
I'm trying to set little goals for myself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:27"><subtitle>
Like, in a couple months,I'll beat my record for being sober.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:30"><subtitle>
-Nice!-Yeah, so that's...that's something to aim for,but then, uh, after that, um...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:36"><subtitle>
After that, you'll beat your record again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:39"><subtitle>
Every day, you'll set a new record.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:41"><subtitle>
Sure. But it's easy now. In jail.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:43"><subtitle>
I don't have tomake any choices for myself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:45"><subtitle>
I worry about what's gonna happenwhen I get out.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:48"><subtitle>
-What if I relapse again?-Then you'll get sober again.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:51"><subtitle>
-<description>groans</description>-Let me tell you something.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:53"><subtitle>
I was at the office the other day,doing the "Hokey Pokey"with some work associates...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:09:57"><subtitle>
-Uh-huh.-...and I realizedeveryone misunderstands that song.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:00"><subtitle>
"The Hokey Pokey"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:02"><subtitle>
Yeah, there's way too much emphasison the "hokey pokey" part.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:05"><subtitle>
That is what it's all about.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:07"><subtitle>
No. That's exactly what I mean.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:09"><subtitle>
-That's not what the song is saying.-Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:11"><subtitle>
And I was thinking about my mom,you know, my relationship with my mom.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:15"><subtitle>
It's weird. You know, awkward.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:18"><subtitle>
I feel like she doesn't really get me,but, you know, she's trying.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:22"><subtitle>
And a couple years ago,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:23"><subtitle>
I never thought I would haveany kind of relationship with her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:27"><subtitle>
Like, I was sure of it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:28"><subtitle>
What changed?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:29"><subtitle>
I don't know. I did? Or-- Or she did?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:33"><subtitle>
Or, um, we... are?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:36"><subtitle>
-Huh.-So, that's what I'm talking about.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:39"><subtitle>
It's like the song says.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:41"><subtitle>
"You do the hokey pokeyand you turn yourself around."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:44"><subtitle>
You turn yourself around.That's what it's all about.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:49"><subtitle>
Yeah, I don't know if the songwritersput that much thoughtinto the existential significanceof the lyrics.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:54"><subtitle>
They literally rhyme "about" with "about."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:10:56"><subtitle>
But isn't the point of artless what people put into itand more what people get out of it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:01"><subtitle>
-Is that the point of art?-Maybe.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:03"><subtitle>
Or maybe art doesn't need a point.Maybe that's why it's called art.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:08"><subtitle>
I can't tellif you're being smart or stupid.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:10"><subtitle>
Oh, I never know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:12"><subtitle>
I think you had it for a momentand then you lost it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:15"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:16"><subtitle>
Oh, well!It was nice while it lasted, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:20"><subtitle>
Sure. It was nice while it lasted.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:45"><subtitle>
No, you produced the hell out of it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:47"><subtitle>
What'd you think about the partwhere the priest got murderedand Judah had to figure outwhich bridesmaid was the culprit?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:53"><subtitle>
A little outside the box,as far as weddings go,but it worked in context.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:56"><subtitle>
I thought so, too!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:11:58"><subtitle>
Congratulations.And Judah, too. Where is he?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:01"><subtitle>
I think he's going over some contracts.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:04"><subtitle>
We're putting togetheran all-female rebootof 12 Angry Men.</subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:10"><subtitle>
-Not 12?-You gotta leave room for a sequel.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:13"><subtitle>
So your groom is doing paperworkduring his own wedding reception?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:17"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:20"><subtitle>
-What?-I invited the town's top talent,took away their phones,and shuffled them together.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:25"><subtitle>
Give 'em some booze, get 'em chatty,next day, they're calling me,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:28"><subtitle>
"Hey, could you put me in touchwith so-and-so?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:30"><subtitle>
-Boom! I've attached myself as a producer!-Does that really work?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:33"><subtitle>
Hey, Jennifer Jason Leigh!Have you met regular Jason Lee?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:38"><subtitle>
You're my two favorite Jason Lees.Discuss.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:41"><subtitle>
Well, I am offended I wasn'timportant enough for your real wedding,but I'm flattered I'm important enoughfor your industry one.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:47"><subtitle>
Are you kidding?"Horny Unicorn" is tracking huge.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:50"><subtitle>
-What?-All of Hollywoobis buzzing about your comeback.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:53"><subtitle>
No. Did you say "Hollywoob"?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:12:56"><subtitle>
If this movie does what it's supposed to,the district attorney's not the only onewho's gonna wanna lock you into something.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:01"><subtitle>
I'm not sureI should take on more projects.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:03"><subtitle>
I started this drama program at prisonand we're doing Hedda Gabler.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:07"><subtitle>
I mean, it's not Strindberg,but, you know, we're having a good time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:10"><subtitle>
I thought that maybe when I got out,I could go back and volunteer.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:13"><subtitle>
Oh! Well, that sounds fabulous!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:14"><subtitle>
Yeah, but... <description>stammers</description> I didn't eventhink that I'd have other options.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:17"><subtitle>
A year ago,everyone in this town hated me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:19"><subtitle>
People have short memories.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:21"><subtitle>
It's the best and worst thingabout people.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:23"><subtitle>
Well, maybe there's a way I could do both?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:26"><subtitle>
-I've really enjoyed teaching.-Oh! Oh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:27"><subtitle>
Maybe I could direct something?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:29"><subtitle>
-I'm sorry I said anything. I---Well, I mean, hold on.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:31"><subtitle>
Yeah, I shouldn'tjust jump into something,but if there's a good opportunity,I'd be stupid not to take it, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:36"><subtitle>
I mean, we both know how hard it isto get heat in this town.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:39"><subtitle>
Think it over.I'm sure you'll make the right decision.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:41"><subtitle>
Well, a decision.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:56"><subtitle>
<description>both chuckle</description></subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:13:57"><subtitle>
You know, I had this weird ideawhen I heard you were getting marriedthat I'd get hereand there'd be some disaster,and I knew that either I would cause itor, just maybe,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:08"><subtitle>
I would be the only one who could fix it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:10"><subtitle>
A disaster, huh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:11"><subtitle>
Not like a "disaster" disaster,like a sitcom disaster, you know?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:15"><subtitle>
Like, it would be time for the weddingand no one would know where to find you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:18"><subtitle>
-No one but you, right?-Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:20"><subtitle>
And I'd find you in some special spotand I'd say, "Come on, it's time to go."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:25"><subtitle>
And you'd say,"What am I doing, BoJack?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:27"><subtitle>
<description>chuckles</description> And then what,I'd run off with you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:30"><subtitle>
No, I would talk youinto going through with it,and it would be like a symbolof how much I'd grown,that I could let you go.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:37"><subtitle>
I'm sorry to disappoint you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:39"><subtitle>
No, I mean, I'm happy for you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:40"><subtitle>
Just... it's a better storyif you had cold feet.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:43"><subtitle>
It's a better story for you.I think I like it better this way.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:47"><subtitle>
I guess you're right.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:49"><subtitle>
What would you have said to me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:51"><subtitle>
Oh, I don't know. I would have said, uh,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:54"><subtitle>
-"Come on, man. Do it."-<description>chuckles</description> Oh, wow.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:14:57"><subtitle>
No, no, no. I would-- Okay. Hold on.Tell me what you're afraid of.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:01"><subtitle>
In this make-believe scenariothat you came up with?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:05"><subtitle>
-Yeah.-Okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:06"><subtitle>
Well, I guess I'm afraidof losing some part of myself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:11"><subtitle>
I'm afraid that if I let someone elsetake care of methat I'm not really me anymore.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:16"><subtitle>
I'm afraid of getting too comfortable,you know, going soft.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:19"><subtitle>
I'm afraid that this could bethe best thing that ever happened to meand if it doesn't make meas happy as I'm supposed to be,that means I'm a lost cause.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:29"><subtitle>
-Holy shit.-What?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:31"><subtitle>
I don't know,those are some really good arguments.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:33"><subtitle>
-Are you kidding me?!-Okay, okay, look.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:35"><subtitle>
Yes, all those things could be true,but on the other hand,what if you deserve to be happyand this is a thingthat will make you happy?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:43"><subtitle>
And maybe don't worryabout whether you'll be happy laterand just focuson how you're happy right now?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:50"><subtitle>
-Oh, is it that easy?-No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:52"><subtitle>
But you're here because, at some point,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:54"><subtitle>
Princess Carolyn thoughtthis was a good idea.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:57"><subtitle>
And I think we oughta listen to her.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:15:59"><subtitle>
Because she's the smartest woman I know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:01"><subtitle>
That's true. She is.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:03"><subtitle>
So, what do you think?Are you gonna marry him?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:06"><subtitle>
Well, I already got the dress.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:10"><subtitle>
But you didn't need meto say any of that, did you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:13"><subtitle>
I guess I didn't.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:15"><subtitle>
Hey, if I do decideto get back into the businesswhen I get out of prison...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:19"><subtitle>
I mean, I probably won't, but if I do,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:22"><subtitle>
I'm gonna need representation.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:25"><subtitle>
Someone who can look out for me,help me make the right decisions,keep me out of trouble...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:16:30"><subtitle>

You don't need to explain yourself to me.</subtitle>

<timestamp time="00:17:30"><subtitle>
I know you thinkI'm some kind of a sell-out,but it wasn't like other opportunitieswere banging down my door...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:34"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:17:59"><subtitle>
I never know what to dowith my hands at parties.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:00"><subtitle>
No, I wish I had my phoneso I could play youthe last voicemail you left me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:05"><subtitle>
Did you remember that,that you left me a voicemail?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:08"><subtitle>
<description>inhales</description> Ooh.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:10"><subtitle>
I thought you were sober.You told me you were sober.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:13"><subtitle>
And things were good in my lifeand I was thinking about my future,and then I woke up one morningand I had this voicemail.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:19"><subtitle>
Look, I-I wasn't in the--</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:21"><subtitle>
You were happy on the voicemail.You sounded happy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:24"><subtitle>
Or lightly sardonic, or glibly nihilistic,or however you'd describethat thing you getthat's the closest to the emotionnormal people call happy.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:30"><subtitle>
-I'm sorry---And you were clearly intoxicated,and you were talking about swimming."I'm going swimming," you said.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:35"><subtitle>
"Since nothing matters anyway,and nobody cares about me,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:38"><subtitle>
-I might as well go swimming, right?"-I'm so sorry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:40"><subtitle>
"Call me backif you don't want me to go swimming.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:42"><subtitle>
Otherwise, I'm just gonna assumeyou don't care."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:47"><subtitle>
I thought you were dead.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:49"><subtitle>
For seven hours,I couldn't get in touch with anyoneand I was sure you were dead,and it was my fault for leaving you,for feeling good, for not worrying.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:18:57"><subtitle>
When I left for Chicago,you promised me you were gonna be okay,but I made you promise me that.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:04"><subtitle>
-Was I selfish for believing you?-No.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:06"><subtitle>
Why did you call me?You knew I was in Chicago.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:08"><subtitle>
I don't know. I was drunkand-- and I was high.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:11"><subtitle>
And I just... I wanted to talk to you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:16"><subtitle>
When I found out you weren't dead,I was angry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:19"><subtitle>
I was relieved, but I was also angrythat I'd given you that power over me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:25"><subtitle>
I was angry at you for a really long time.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:28"><subtitle>
Are you still angry at me?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:30"><subtitle>
No. I don't know.What good has being angry at you</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:34"><subtitle>
-ever done for me?-I'm sorry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:36"><subtitle>
I wish I could have beenthe person you thought I was,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:38"><subtitle>
-the person who would save you.-That was never your job.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:40"><subtitle>
Then why did you always make mefeel like it was?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:44"><subtitle>
I don't know, maybe it's everybody's jobto save each other.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:47"><subtitle>
I don't know.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:50"><subtitle>
Anyway, I'm glad you're alive.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:53"><subtitle>
I am, too.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:19:56"><subtitle>
So, you're still in Chicago, then, or...?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:01"><subtitle>
When I got that voicemail,my boyfriend at the timewanted me to move to Houston with him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:08"><subtitle>
I wanted to move with him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:10"><subtitle>
But after you called, I got scared.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:13"><subtitle>
-Oh, no.-I didn't trust myself.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:15"><subtitle>
I was happy and I didn't trust that.So I stayed in Chicago.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:19"><subtitle>
We tried to make it work long distance,but it was hard.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:24"><subtitle>
Eventually, I just thought,"This is stupid."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:27"><subtitle>
So, what, you broke up with him?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:29"><subtitle>
No. I moved to Houston.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:31"><subtitle>
To be with your boyfriend at the time?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:33"><subtitle>
Yeah. Plus, the winters in Chicagoare cold as shit,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:35"><subtitle>
I don't know why anyonewould build a city there.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:37"><subtitle>
No wonder that cow started that fire.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:39"><subtitle>
I get it. I'm on Team Cow.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:41"><subtitle>
But your boyfriend at the time,he's not your boyfriend anymore?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:44"><subtitle>
He is not.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:48"><subtitle>
-Wow.-Yeah.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:51"><subtitle>
How'd you learn how to trust it?The happiness?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:54"><subtitle>
I didn't. But I trust him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:20:59"><subtitle>
It's hard to imagine you in Houston.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:02"><subtitle>
Oh, I'm likea totally different person now.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:03"><subtitle>
-Are you?-No?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:06"><subtitle>
Yes? I wear fewer jackets.I smile more.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:10"><subtitle>
Sometimes I look back at my LA years,and I think, "Who was that person?"</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:14"><subtitle>
Does she ever come back, that Diane?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:16"><subtitle>
Sometimes.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:18"><subtitle>
I felt her when I got back to LA.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:20"><subtitle>
I feel her now that I'm talking to you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:23"><subtitle>
But it's not you?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:24"><subtitle>
I mean, it's all me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:26"><subtitle>
I'd love to say,"No, she's gone forever."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:29"><subtitle>
But I was terrifiedof coming back here for the wedding.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:33"><subtitle>
-Seeing Mr. Peanutbutter. Seeing you.-What'd you think was gonna happen?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:36"><subtitle>
I don't know, I would spin out,start questioning everything,blow everything up.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:41"><subtitle>
But that didn't happen, did it?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:44"><subtitle>
No. That didn't happen.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:46"><subtitle>
But was part of youkinda hoping that it would?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:49"><subtitle>
Mm.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:51"><subtitle>
You ever miss the mess?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:53"><subtitle>
No, "miss" is the wrong word.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:55"><subtitle>
Sorry, Miss.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:21:57"><subtitle>
I'm glad I lived in LA,but I'm not nostalgic for it.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:00"><subtitle>
I'm glad I knew Mr. Peanutbutter,</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:03"><subtitle>
-even though he's not in my life anymore.-Yeah?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:05"><subtitle>
I think there are people that help youbecome the person that you end up being,and you can be grateful for themeven if they were nevermeant to be in your life forever.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:15"><subtitle>
I'm glad I knew you, too.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:18"><subtitle>
"Knew," huh?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:19"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:29"><subtitle>
-Um, anyway, I---I need to tell you...</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:32"><subtitle>
No. You don't have to--You don't owe me anything.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:34"><subtitle>
No, I need to tell you: Thank you.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:22:37"><subtitle>
And it's going to be okay.</subtitle>
</timestamp>

<timestamp time="00:23:02"><subtitle>
So we have this movie nightat the prison, right?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:04"><subtitle>
And we get to voteon what movies we wanna see.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:07"><subtitle>
But of course the whole thing's rigged,because Big Andy's favorite movieis The Family Stone,so Big Andy gets his guysto vote for it every week,and so every weekwe watch The Family Stone.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:17"><subtitle>
Hold on, whose favorite movieis The Family Stone?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:20"><subtitle>

-But every week?-That's what I'm saying!</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:24"><subtitle>
So, one day I'm like, "If I seeLuke Wilson teach Sarah Jessica Parkerhow to let her freak flag flyone more time, I'm gonna snap."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:30"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:33"><subtitle>

</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:35"><subtitle>
What am I, a philistine?I support the arts, sue me.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:37"><subtitle>
Okay, sorry.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:38"><subtitle>
But I know a guywho volunteers in the library,which is where they keep the DVDs,so I make a deal with him.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:44"><subtitle>
"I'll give you my Jell-O for a monthif The Family Stone goes missing."</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:48"><subtitle>
I feel like this doesn't end well.</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:50"><subtitle>
So, movie might comes around,time for another Christmas in Connecticut,but then, uh-oh, the DVD's gone,what do we do?</subtitle>
</timestamp>
<timestamp time="00:23:56"><subtitle>
So Big Andy's getting really upset,and his guys are all riled,and then I go, "Fellas, fellas, fellas!</subtitle>
